## Markdown Formatting Rules (mandatory)
When writing Markdown documents, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure consistency and readability:
- Use **headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content hierarchically.
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for lists.
- Use **tables** where appropriate (e.g., for metrics, dependencies).
- Wrap any code examples in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Use **consistent indentation** and clear formatting throughout.
- Follow clean, simple structure as used in professional technical documentation.
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms or concepts.
- Use **italics** for emphasis on specific terms or concepts.
- Use **links** for references to external documentation or resources.
- Use **inline code** formatting for specific terms or commands (e.g., `Get-Process`).
- Use symbols for pros and cons, e.g., ✅ for pros and ❌ for cons.
- Use symbols for impact, e.g., 🔴 for high impact, 🟠 for medium impact, 🟢 for low impact, writing also the impact as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for risk, e.g., 🔴 for high risk, 🟠 for medium risk, 🟢 for low risk, writing also the risk as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for long-term fit, e.g., 🔴 for low long-term fit, 🟠 for medium long-term fit, 🟢 for high long-term fit, writing also the long-term fit as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for priority, e.g., 🔴 for high priority, 🟠 for medium priority, 🟢 for low priority, writing also the priority as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for severity, e.g., 🔴 for high severity, 🟠 for medium severity, 🟢 for low severity, writing also the severity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for complexity, e.g., 🔴 for high complexity, 🟠 for medium complexity, 🟢 for low complexity, writing also the complexity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for cost, e.g., 🔴 for high cost, 🟠 for medium cost, 🟢 for low cost, writing also the cost as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for support, e.g., ✅ for supported, ❌ for not supported, writing also the support status as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for used in the application, e.g., ✅ for used in the application, ❌ for not used in the application,❔ for likely, writing also the used in the application status as text after the symbol  

## Generic Mermaid Diagram Rules (mandatory)
When including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown document, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
- **Only the following Mermaid diagram types are allowed**: 'flowchart TD', 'sequenceDiagram','classDiagram','stateDiagram','erDiagram','gantt','journey','gitGraph','pie','mindmap','zenuml','quadrantChart','xychart-beta','block-beta','packet-beta','treemap-beta'.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x (Starts with "Figure X - " (for example, "Figure 1 - ")).
- The Mermaid diagram **must be placed exactly where it is referenced** in the document. Do not place it at the end or elsewhere
- If any node label contains **HTML tags** such as `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc., the **entire label must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`)**.
   - Correct example:
     `step1["Start <b>Process</b>"]`
   - Incorrect example:
     `step1[Start <b>Process</b>]`
     (This will break rendering and must be avoided.)
- Always **validate the Mermaid syntax** before including the diagram. The syntax must be correct to ensure the diagram renders properly in the final Markdown output. If validation is not possible, use only syntax known to be 100% correct.
- **Final checklist before including a Mermaid diagram:**
 - Validate Mermaid syntax to ensure no errors.
 - Enclose any HTML-containing node labels in double quotes.
 - Place the diagram exactly where referenced.
 - Immediately follow the diagram with a properly formatted caption starting with "Figure X -"
 - Make sure the caption is visually secondary and centered.
 - Use the following rules for all Mermaid diagram types (`flowchart`, `classDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, etc.) to ensure valid, portable, and compatible diagrams.

### General Unsupported Syntax (Do Not Use)

- Do not use special characters in identifiers or class names:
  - Avoid: \*, #, /, <>, {}, &, @, \$, \[]
  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores

- Do not use smart quotes:
  - Avoid: “ ”, ‘ ’
  - Use plain double or single quotes: "text", 'text'

- Do not use emojis or non-ASCII characters in any labels or class names

- Do not use HTML or Markdown formatting inside labels:
  - Avoid: <b>bold</b>, **bold**, fa\:icon, etc.

- Do not use empty curly braces:
  - Invalid: `class Foo {}` (if no members are defined)
  - Valid: `class Foo` for empty classes

- Do not leave special characters or spaces in labels without wrapping them in quotes:
  - Invalid: A\[User/Admin]
  - Valid: A\["User/Admin"]

- Do not reference undefined nodes or classes in relationships:
  - All identifiers used in edges (A --> B) must be declared

- Do not use multiple edge definitions on a single line:
  - Invalid: A --> B --> C
  - Valid: one edge per line

- Do not use nested or double curly braces like `{{`:
  - Only use `B{"Decision"}` where decision nodes are allowed

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: PascalCase or snake\_case

- Quote all labels containing:

  * Spaces: "Back Office"
  * Special characters: "Read/Write"
  * Dashes or dots: "Version 1.0"

- Format diagrams using fenced code blocks:

  ````
  ```mermaid
  diagramType
  ...
  ````

  ```
  ```

- Use `note` syntax correctly when supported:

  ```
  note for ClassName "Description here"
  ```

- Validate diagrams in your rendering context (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor)

### Diagram-Specific Rules

#### flowchart

- Use square brackets for nodes: A\["Label"]
- Use curly braces only for decisions: B{"Yes or No?"}
- Edges must use -->, <--, --- (no mixing)
- Do not use the class keyword

#### classDiagram

- Use `class ClassName {}` only when listing attributes or methods
- Do not use symbols like "\*" for class names
- For "everything" or "all" access, define a placeholder class such as AllEntities
- Use these for relationships:
  - Inheritance: Child <|-- Parent
  - Association: A ..> B : "Label"

#### sequenceDiagram

- Define all participants before referencing them
- Use only supported message arrows: ->>, -->> etc.
- Loops and conditions must follow valid syntax

### Summary

- Only use plain ASCII characters
- Avoid all special formatting, smart symbols, and undeclared references
- Always test your diagram using a Mermaid-compatible renderer

The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure, using table format. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities the role interacts with, e.g., "User, Role, Permission, SystemConfig
, AuditLog.")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the role, e.g., "Inferred from code blocks checking for a specific role name ('Admin'), a boolean flag ('isAdmin'), or a user ID of 0 or 1.")

Include a Mermaid 'classDiagram' diagram to visualize the relationships between the user roles, their permissions, and the key data entities they interact with.

### 2.4. Core business capabilities
This section lists the main, high-level capabilities of the application, representing its "Epics" or major functional domains, using table format

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities, e.g., "[InputData], [StagingRecord], [ImportLog].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the capability, e.g., "Assumes that any module listening for external input (file watchers, API endpoints) is part of this capability. Inferred from service layers or classes with names like `Processor`, `Engine`, `Calculator`, or `Orchestrator`.") 

Include a Mermaid applicable diagram to visualize the core business capabilities and their relationships.

### 2.5. Detailed feature breakdown
This critical section provides a granular breakdown of individual features within each Core Business Capability, using table format. Each feature is described in terms of its user story, key data entities involved, and any inferred logic or flowcharts that illustrate the internal workings.

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Feature** (e.g., Execute [Process Name], Generate [Report Name], etc.)

##Critical instructions for these sections (Functional overview section an subsections):
- Rule 1: Source Code is the Only Truth. Your analysis **MUST** be based exclusively and entirely on a deep-dive analysis of provided source code. Do **NOT** invent features or use external knowledge about common business practices unless it is a direct and logical inference from a code artifact. Every piece of functionality you document must be traceable to a class, method, UI element, database query, or data model found in the code.
- Rule 2: Explicitly State All Assumptions. When the code's intent is ambiguous (e.g., a poorly named variable or function), you **MUST** make a logical inference and clearly label it as an "Assumption."
 - Example:** In the 'Assumptions' column, write: *"Assuming the boolean flag `is_mgr` in the `User` class denotes a 'Manager' role with supervisory capabilities."
-Rule 3: Functional "What," Not Technical "How."* You must relentlessly translate technical implementation details into business-centric functional descriptions. Your audience is business stakeholders and new developers who need to understand purpose, not implementation.
- **BAD (Technical):** "The `btnSubmit_Click` event handler calls the `SaveOrderToDB` method, which executes an `INSERT` SQL statement."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The 'Submit New Order' feature allows a user to persist the order details into the system's database."
 - **BAD (Technical):** "The system uses a `List<Customer>` object to hold the data."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The system manages a collection of 'Customer' data entities."
- Rule 4: Strict Adherence to the Template. You **MUST** follow the provided Markdown template precisely, section by section. Populate all tables as requested. Generate the specified Mermaid diagrams for each section where they apply, ensuring the syntax is correct and enclosed in proper Markdown code fences (e.g., ` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
- Rule 5: Be Universal and Reusable. Your final output should use generic placeholders (e.g., `[PrimaryBusinessObject]`, `[User Role]`, `[Process Name]`) as instructed in the template. This ensures the document you generate serves as a perfect, reusable template for analyzing any application in the future.
- Do not begin generating the response until you have fully understood these five critical rules.

##Instructions for this section:
 - Given the detailed analysis of this .NET application, provide three complete modernization strategies in a table format, and the step-by-step plan, also in a table format, to implement them.
 - Strategy 1: **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)**, maintaining the application current deployment model (e.g. on-premises) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 2: **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**, rehosting the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 3: **Refactor** (also known as "Repackage"), refactoring the application to use modern design patterns, architectures and technologies, e.g., microservices, serverless, cloud-native, etc, evolving the application to the latest .NET version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc.
 - Provide a table with comparison between the three strategies, including the pros and cons of each one with the following columns:
  - **Factor** (e.g., Complexity, Cost (Development), Cost (Functional testing), Cost (Infrastructure), Time to implement (Development), Time to test (Functional testing), Time to implement (Infrastructure), Risk, Long-term fit, time-to-market, etc.)
  - **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)
  - **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting)
  - **Complete Refactor** (Refactor)

- The complexity and the time estimate to implement each strategy depends on the following factors which are only related with the development effort and not with the infrastructure or deployment effort:
 - Complexity low - the application is small, with few dependencies and a simple architecture = 1-2 weeks
 - Complexity medium - the application is medium-sized, with some dependencies and a moderate architecture = 3-5 weeks
 - Complexity high - the application is large, with many dependencies and a complex architecture = 6-8 weeks
 - Complexity very high - the application is very large, with many dependencies and a very complex architecture = 9-12 weeks

 ##Instruction: You must separate the development effort from the infrastructure or deployment effort, so the complexity and time estimate must be only related with the development effort.

- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x.
- ALWAYS VALIDATE / ENSURE THE DIAGRAM SYNTAX BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT, TO ENSURE IT IS CORRECT AND WILL RENDER PROPERLY IN THE FINAL MARKDOWN OUTPUT.

#Critical instructions for the caption (always apply):
- Immediately following the ` ```mermaid ` code block, you MUST place a text **caption**.

## 2. Functional overview
This section provides a high-level functional decomposition of the application, using table format. It identifies the major, distinct functional blocks or modules as inferred from the code's high-level structure (e.g., top-level namespaces, solution folders, primary class groups). This overview serves as a map to the application's core responsibilities.

### 2.1. Executive summary
This section provides a high-level summary of the application's primary purpose and its core function from a business or operational perspective, using table format. The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | To serve as a back-office "Image Concentrator" system for processing financial documents (likely cheques) and remittances originating from bank branches and other sources. |
| **Core Function** | The application automates the ingestion, validation, processing, and status tracking of document batches (remittances). It provides a rich desktop interface for operators to monitor these activities, handle exceptions, manage system configuration, and generate reports. |
| **Key Processes** | - Ingestion of remittance data from files (`ENVM`, `ACOM`).<br>- Automated processing of remittances and document tranches via a Windows Service (`CIServico`).<br>- Manual monitoring and intervention through a Windows Forms application (`CIControlo`).<br>- Alerting and notification for system events and errors.<br>- Reporting on processing volumes and statuses. |

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

| Functional Area / Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Interaction & Presentation** | Manages all user-facing windows and controls. This module is the primary interface for operators to monitor workflows, manage configurations, and perform manual actions. It is implemented as a Windows Forms MDI application. |
| **Core Process Execution Engine** | A background Windows Service that drives all automated processing. It continuously polls for new work (remittances, alerts) and executes the corresponding business logic in a threaded manner. |
| **Remittance & Document Processing** | Contains the core business logic for handling remittances. This includes validating data, breaking remittances into processable batches (tranches), updating statuses, and handling errors. |
| **Alerting & Notification** | A dedicated subsystem for generating and dispatching system alerts. It supports multiple notification channels, including database logging, file logging, Windows Event Viewer, and email (EWS/WebDAV). |
| **File-based Integration** | Responsible for handling data exchange with external systems through structured files. It includes logic for parsing specific file formats (`ENVM`, `ACOM`), moving processed files, and managing file system paths. |
| **Data Persistence & Management** | Encapsulates all direct interactions with the SQL Server database. While not a formal data access layer, various classes throughout the application use `System.Data.SqlClient` to execute raw SQL queries and stored procedures. |
| **Configuration Management** | Provides the logic and UI for managing system parameters, user accounts, and branch (`Balcão`) configurations. This allows administrators to tune the application's behavior without code changes. |
| **Reporting** | Integrates with Crystal Reports to generate and display various operational and business reports, such as remittance listings and monthly billing summaries. |

### 2.3. User roles and permissions
The application implements a simple role-based access control system, primarily distinguishing between standard users and privileged administrators.

| Role | Description | Permissions | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | A privileged user with full control over the system, including configuration and manual process overrides. Corresponds to `UserGroup <= 1`. | - Full CRUD on most entities.<br>- Ability to change the state of remittances and tranches.<br>- Access to system configuration and user management. | `MudarEstado`, `Reenviar...EmErro`, `Update_Utilizadores`, `Insert_Balcao` | `User`, `Balcao`, `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `ActivityChange` | Inferred from `ConfirmaPrivilegios()` checks (`m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup > 1`) which lock down sensitive operations. |
| **Standard Operator** | A standard user responsible for monitoring and performing routine operational tasks. Corresponds to `UserGroup > 1`. | - Read-only access to most data.<br>- Ability to view activities, remittances, and documents.<br>- Cannot change critical system states or configurations. | `ViewActividades`, `ViewDocumento`, `Refresh` | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Alerta` | Inferred as the default role for users who fail the `UserGroup <= 1` privilege check. |

### 2.7. Business process workflows
This section describes and visualizes critical end-to-end processes, showing how different user roles and system features interact.

| Process | Description | Key Steps | User Roles Involved | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Remittance Processing** | A comprehensive workflow that outlines the steps involved in processing remittances from ingestion to final output. | 1. Remittance is created in the database (status: open).<br>2. `CIServico` picks up the remittance for processing (status: processing).<br>3. Documents are grouped into tranches.<br>4. Tranches are sent to an external system (e.g., via web service).<br>5. Remittance status is updated to processed/closed. | System (automated), Back-Office Operator (monitoring) | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This is the primary "happy path" workflow inferred from the service and form logic. |
| **Error Handling and Manual Intervention** | The workflow for managing and resolving remittances or documents that fail automated processing. | 1. A processing error occurs.<br>2. An alert is generated (`Alerta`).<br>3. An Administrator reviews the failed item in the UI.<br>4. The Administrator manually changes the item's state (e.g., to "re-process").<br>5. The item re-enters the standard processing workflow. | Administrator, Standard Operator (viewing alerts) | `Remessa`, `Alerta`, `ActivityChange` | Inferred from the existence of `MudarEstadoForm` and error-related statuses. |
| **Alert Notification** | The process by which the system notifies stakeholders about critical events. | 1. An event triggers a `Situacao`.<br>2. The system looks up associated `Accao` records.<br>3. The system executes each action (e.g., sends an email, writes to a log file).<br>4. The alert action status is marked as processed. | System (automated), Administrator (recipient) | `Alerta`, `SituacaoAccao`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `Alerta` and `CIServAlertas` projects. |

#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Standard Remittance Processing
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Standard Remittance Processing workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Remittance Creation** | A new remittance record is created in the database with an initial "open" or "ready" status. This is likely done by an upstream system or file import process. | System | `Remessa` | Assumes an external trigger creates the initial record. |
| **2. Processing Pickup** | The `CIServico` Windows Service polls the database and picks up the new remittance for processing, changing its status to "processing". | System | `Remessa` | Inferred from `REMIN_IDParaProcessar()` method. |
| **3. Tranche Creation** | The service logic groups the documents within the remittance into one or more tranches based on system rules (e.g., `MaxDocsTranche` parameter). | System | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | Inferred from `TratarTranchesBalcao` and `CriarTranche`. |
| **4. Document Processing** | Each document within a tranche is processed. This may involve validation, data enrichment, and image conversion. | System | `Documento`, `Tranche` | Inferred from `ProcessaDocumento`. |
| **5. Tranche Transmission** | The processed tranches are sent to an external system, likely via a web service. The tranche status is updated upon success or failure. | System | `Tranche` | Inferred from context; the purpose of a tranche is typically for transmission. |
| **6. Finalization** | Once all tranches are successfully processed, the parent remittance is marked as "closed" or "processed". | System | `Remessa` | This is the logical end-state of a successful workflow. |

#### 2.7.2. Workflow: Error Handling and Manual Intervention
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Error Handling and Manual Intervention workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Error Detection** | An error occurs during the automated processing of a remittance, tranche, or document. The item's status is set to an error state (e.g., -40). | System | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from `try-catch` blocks and error handling logic in `ServRemessa`. |
| **2. Alert Generation** | The system automatically generates an `Alerta` record corresponding to the error situation. | System | `Alerta` | Inferred from calls to `EnviarAlertaSituacao`. |
| **3. Notification** | The `CIServAlertas` logic picks up the new alert and executes the configured actions (e.g., sends an email to an administrator). | System | `Accao`, `Alerta` | Inferred from the `ServAlerta` class. |
| **4. User Review** | An Administrator logs into the `CIControlo` application and navigates to the activity monitor to review the item in an error state. | Administrator | `Remessa` | This is the primary use case for the UI's monitoring forms. |
| **5. Manual State Change** | The Administrator uses the context menu to manually change the state of the failed item, for example, to re-queue it for processing. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `ActivityChange` | Inferred from `MudarEstadoForm` and its invocation from the UI. |
| **6. Re-processing** | The item, now in a valid starting state, is picked up again by the `CIServico` during its next polling cycle, re-entering the standard workflow. | System | `Remessa` | Assumes the state change makes it eligible for re-processing. |

### 2.8. System inputs & outputs (interfaces)
This section catalogs all identified points where data enters or leaves the application boundary.

| Type | Name / Description | Data Formats | Data Source / Sink | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | **File Ingestion (ENVM/ACOM)** | Fixed-width text files (`.txt`, `.*`) | Monitored file system directory (`C:\tmp\` by default) | Inferred from `CIFicheiro` project and classes like `FicheiroEnvm` and `FicheiroAcom`. The service likely watches a directory for new files to process. |
| **Input** | **User Interface Actions** | User-driven events (clicks, text entry) | Windows Forms UI (`CIControlo`, `CIActividades`) | The application is interactive, allowing operators to provide input to filter data, change states, and manage configurations. |
| **Output** | **Database Writes** | SQL Commands | Microsoft SQL Server | The application's primary function is to process data and persist the results and state changes to a central database. |
| **Output** | **Email Notifications** | SMTP (via EWS or WebDAV) | External Email Gateway | The `Alerta` system is configured to send emails as a notification action, as seen in `ServAlertasSendWebmail.cs`. |
| **Output** | **Log Files** | Text files | Local/Network file system | The `Alerta` system can be configured to write logs to a file, as seen in `ServAlertasLogFile.cs`. |
| **Output** | **Windows Event Log** | Event Log Entries | Windows Operating System | The `Alerta` system can write warnings and errors to the Windows Event Log. `CIServico` also logs its start/stop events. |
| **Data Flow** | **Internal Database-Driven Workflow** | In-memory objects (`Remessa`, `Documento`) | Application Memory -> Database | Data is read from the database, processed by the business logic in `CIServRemessas`, and the updated state is written back to the database. |
| **Data Flow** | **Web Service Call (MDI)** | SOAP/XML | External Web Service (`http://waiaccesstu/...`) | The `MDIWebTransmCI` project makes outbound SOAP calls to an external service for document insertion. |

### 2.9. User Task Flows
This section describes the typical path a user takes through the application to achieve a high-level objective.

| Task Flow | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resolve a Failed Remittance** | A complete sequence of steps an administrator follows to identify, diagnose, and resolve a remittance that has failed automated processing. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Alerta` | This is a primary task for a privileged user, combining monitoring, investigation, and manual intervention features. |
| **Monitor Daily Processing** | A routine task for an operator to check the status of the day's remittances and identify any bottlenecks or widespread issues. | Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | This flow represents the main day-to-day use of the application's monitoring UI. |
| **Configure a New Branch** | An administrative task to set up a new bank branch (`Balcão`) and its associated processing machines in the system. | Administrator | `Balcao`, `Maquina` | Inferred from the `CIConfiguration` project and the `BalcaoForm`. |

#### 2.9.1. User Task Flow: Resolve a Failed Remittance
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Resolve a Failed Remittance" user task flow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Receive Alert** | The administrator receives an email notification that a remittance has failed. | Administrator | `Alerta` | Assumes email is the primary notification channel for critical errors. |
| **2. Login & Open Dashboard** | The administrator launches the `CIControlo` application and opens the `ActividadeBalcaoForm`. | Administrator | - | Standard application entry point. |
| **3. Filter for Errors** | The administrator uses the toolbar filters to show only items in an "Error" state for the relevant date. | Administrator | `Remessa` | Inferred from the UI controls on `ActividadeBalcaoForm`. |
| **4. Identify Failed Item** | The administrator identifies the specific remittance mentioned in the alert from the summary list. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user matches data from the alert to the UI. |
| **5. Drill Down to Details** | The administrator double-clicks the remittance to view its tranches, and then a tranche to view its individual documents, looking for the source of the error. | Administrator | `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the drill-down capabilities of the UI's list views. |
| **6. View Document Image** | If the error is document-related, the administrator views the document image to check for issues like poor scan quality or incorrect data. | Administrator | `Documento`, `Imagem` | Inferred from the "Ver Imagem" feature. |
| **7. Change State for Re-processing** | After diagnosing the issue (and possibly correcting data externally), the administrator right-clicks the remittance and uses the "Mudar Estado" feature to reset its status. | Administrator | `Remessa` | This is the core manual intervention action. |
| **8. Confirm Resolution** | The administrator later re-checks the dashboard to confirm the remittance has been successfully re-processed by the automated service. | Administrator | `Remessa` | Final step to ensure the intervention was successful. |

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction.

| Process Name | Trigger / Schedule | Purpose | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Loop** | Continuous polling with a configurable delay (`TempoEntreIteracoes`). | To process new and re-queued remittances as they become available in the database. | 1. `REMIN_IDParaProcessar()`: Get next remittance.<br>2. `ProcessaRemessa()`: Execute the full processing logic for the remittance.<br>3. `TratarTranchesBalcao()`: Process documents in batches. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This is the main loop of the `CIServico` Windows Service, inferred from `CIServicoThread.cs`. |
| **Alert Processing Loop** | Continuous polling with a configurable delay. | To dispatch notifications for newly generated alerts. | 1. `AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar()`: Get next alert.<br>2. `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccao()`: Execute configured actions (e.g., send email). | `Alerta`, `Accao` | Inferred from the logic in `ProcessarAlertas.cs`. |
| **File System Polling** | Continuous polling with a configurable delay (`TempoEntreIteracoesFicheiros`). | To discover and import new `ENVM` and `ACOM` data files from the file system. | 1. `Directory.GetFiles()`: Scan for new files.<br>2. `Ficheiro.processaFile()`: Parse and import the file data into the database.<br>3. `File.Move()`: Move the processed file to a backup location. | `Ficheiro`, `Lote`, `Documento` | Inferred from `CIServicoThread` and the `CIFicheiro` project. |
| **Old File Cleanup** | Scheduled (inferred, as it is a common best practice for such systems). | To prevent the backup directory from growing indefinitely by deleting files older than a configured number of days. | `File.Delete()` on files older than `iNDias`. | `(none)` | Inferred from the existence of the `DeleteOldFiles.cs` class, which is a common utility for such services. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section describes the architectural patterns, styles, and principles used in the application's design.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a traditional monolithic architecture with some service-oriented characteristics for background processing.

| Pattern | Adoption Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture pattern** | **N-Tier Monolithic Application**: The application is structured into distinct layers (presentation, business, data access), but all components are tightly coupled and intended to be deployed as a single unit. |
| **Architectural patterns (UI)** | **Model-View-Presenter (MVP) / MVC-like**: The Windows Forms (`.cs`) files act as the View, while the code-behind (`.cs`) files serve as the Presenter/Controller, handling UI events and orchestrating calls to business logic classes. |
| **Creational patterns** | ❔ **Factory Method (inferred)**: The `Relatorios` class has methods like `ListagemRemessas()` and `resumoDeEnvios()` that create and return specific report form instances, acting as a factory for reports. |
| **Structural patterns** | ❌ **Not explicitly identified**: No clear evidence of structural patterns like Adapter, Decorator, or Proxy in the provided code snippets. |
| **Behavioral patterns** | ❔ **Observer (inferred)**: The main service loop (`CIServicoThread`) acts as an observer, polling the database for state changes (new remittances) to trigger actions. |
| **Domain-driven design (DDD) patterns** | ✅ **Repository (implicit)**: Classes like `ServRemessa` and `ServAlerta` encapsulate data access logic for their respective domains (`Remessa`, `Alerta`), acting as repositories even if not explicitly named as such. They contain methods to fetch and update entities. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application's architecture is primarily a classic Layered style, typical for .NET applications of its era.

| Style | Adoption Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | **3-Tier Layered Architecture**:<br>- **Presentation Layer**: Windows Forms projects (`CIControlo`, `CIActividades`, `CIConfiguration`).<br>- **Business Logic Layer**: Service and library projects (`CIServico`, `CIServRemessas`, `CIServAlertas`).<br>- **Data Access Layer**: Implicitly defined within business logic classes through direct `System.Data.SqlClient` calls. |
| **Dependency flow** | **Strictly one-way**: Dependencies flow from the Presentation layer down to the Business Logic layer, and then to the Data Access logic. Core libraries like `CIConfigGlobalParameters` are shared across layers. |
| **Bounded contexts** | ❌ **Not explicitly defined**: The application is a monolith. While there are logical separations (e.g., Remittance Processing, Alerting), they are not implemented as distinct bounded contexts with their own models and persistence. |
| **Communication between contexts/services** | **Direct Method Calls**: Communication between different modules (projects) is done via direct, synchronous method calls within the same process space. |
| **Use of dependency injection / IOC container** | ❌ **Not used**: Dependencies are managed manually through direct object instantiation (e.g., `new CIServRemessas.ServRemessa(...)`). There is no evidence of an Inversion of Control (IoC) container. |

### 3.3. Key design patterns and principles applied
The codebase reflects design principles common in the .NET 2.0/4.0 era.

| Principle | Adoption Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID principles** | 🟠 **Partial Adherence**: <br>- *Single Responsibility*: Partially followed, with projects dedicated to specific concerns (e.g., `Alerta`, `CIReports`). However, some classes like `ActividadeBalcaoForm` are very large and handle many responsibilities. <br>- *Open/Closed*: Limited evidence. The system is extended by adding new classes rather than modifying existing ones where possible. <br>- *Liskov/Interface Segregation/Dependency Inversion*: Not explicitly used; the architecture relies on concrete implementations rather than abstractions. |
| **DRY (Don't repeat yourself)** | 🟠 **Some Repetition**: There are instances of repeated code, particularly in UI event handlers and data access logic. For example, multiple forms have similar filtering and data-loading logic. |
| **KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)** | ✅ **Generally Followed**: The logic within individual methods is straightforward. The complexity arises from the number of interconnected components and the large size of some UI classes, not from overly-engineered algorithms. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | ✅ **Moderately Achieved**: There is a clear separation between UI projects (`CIActividades`), service logic (`CIServico`), and domain models (`Alerta`). However, data access logic (SQL queries) is often mixed directly within business or UI code-behind classes. |
| **Code organization** | ✅ **Modular by Project**: The solution is well-organized into multiple projects, each with a clear purpose (e.g., `CIReports`, `CIFicheiro`). This provides good high-level modularity. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
The application was likely not designed with modern DDD principles in mind, but it contains some elements that align with DDD concepts.

| DDD Concept | Adoption Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | 🟠 **Implicit Use**: <br>- **Entities**: Classes like `Remessa`, `Documento`, and `Balcao` represent core domain entities with identity and a lifecycle. <br>- **Value Objects**: No clear examples of value objects were identified. <br>- **Aggregates**: The `Remessa` can be seen as an aggregate root that manages the lifecycle of its `Documento` and `Tranche` children. <br>- **Repositories**: Data access logic is encapsulated within service classes (`ServRemessa`), which act as repositories for fetching and persisting entities. |
| **Ubiquitous language** | ✅ **Partially Present**: The code uses business-centric terms like `Remessa` (Remittance), `Balcão` (Branch), and `Estorno` (Reversal), suggesting a language shared with the business domain. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | 🟠 **N-Tier, not DDD**: The architecture is a classic N-Tier structure, not a formal DDD layered architecture (e.g., Application, Domain, Infrastructure layers). The domain logic is present but intertwined with data access and sometimes UI concerns. |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application employs several common software development patterns and tactics.

| Pattern/Tactic | Adoption Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Repository pattern** | ✅ **Implicitly Used**: Service classes like `ServRemessa` and `ServAlerta` contain methods (`REMIN_IDParaProcessar`, `AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar`) that query the database and return domain entities, effectively serving as repositories. |
| **Unit of Work pattern** | 🟠 **Transaction-based**: The `SqlTransaction` object is used in some methods (`m_oParameters.BeginTrans`) to group multiple database operations, providing a form of unit of work at the transaction level, but a formal Unit of Work pattern is not implemented. |
| **Factory pattern** | ❔ **Inferred**: The `CIActividades.Actividades` class has methods like `ControloActividades()` and `ControloPesquisas()` that are responsible for creating and showing specific form instances, acting as a simple factory for UI components. |
| **Service pattern** | ✅ **Explicitly Used**: The application's core background logic is encapsulated in a Windows Service (`CIServico.csproj`), which follows the service pattern for long-running, non-interactive processes. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
The application manages cross-cutting concerns through a mix of shared libraries and direct implementation.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | Implemented via a dedicated `GenericLogNET` library and the `Alerta` project. Supports logging to the database, files, and the Windows Event Viewer. |
| **Configuration Management** | Centralized in the `CIConfigGlobalParameters` project. The `CIGlobalParameters` class reads settings from `.config` files and provides them to the rest of the application. |
| **Security** | - **Authentication**: Appears to be based on the logged-in Windows user (`System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`).<br>- **Authorization**: A simple role-based system checking a `UserGroup` ID. |
| **Exception Handling** | Standard `try-catch` blocks are used throughout the application to handle exceptions. Errors are typically logged to the database or displayed to the user. |
| **Data Serialization / Deserialization** | ❔ **Inferred**: The `CriaXML.cs` class suggests that XML serialization/deserialization is used, likely for communication with external systems or for configuration. |
| **Dependency Injection** | ❌ **Not Used**: Dependencies are created manually via `new` keyword. |

### 3.7. Deployment
The deployment architecture is inferred to be a traditional on-premises model.

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs microservices** | **Monolithic**: The application is a single, tightly-coupled monolith, although it is broken into multiple projects within a single solution. |
| **Scalability design** | 🔴 **Limited**: Scalability is limited to vertical scaling (adding more resources to the host server). The monolithic design and direct database polling do not lend themselves to horizontal scaling. |
| **Containerization** | ❌ **Not Containerized**: The application is a traditional .NET Framework application designed to run on Windows servers, not in containers. |
| **Deployment model** | **On-premises**: Connection strings and file paths point to internal network resources (e.g., `\\sqc6001fas02`, `SDC6001SQL28`). |
| **Deployment target platform** | **Windows Server**: The use of a Windows Service (`CIServico`) and Windows Forms (`CIControlo`) indicates a Windows-based deployment target. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application relies on a standard on-premises Microsoft-centric infrastructure.

| Concern | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | **Microsoft SQL Server**: All data is persisted in a relational SQL Server database. The connection strings suggest different instances for Development, QA, and Production environments. |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | ❌ **Not Used**: The application uses a database-polling mechanism instead of a message broker or event bus for inter-process communication. |
| **External integrations**| - **File System**: Integrates with other systems by reading `ACOM` and `ENVM` files from a shared directory.<br>- **Web Service**: Makes outbound SOAP calls to an MDI (Master Data Index) service for document insertion. |

### 3.9. Documentation artifacts
The available documentation is inferred from the source code structure and content.

| Artifact | Availability & Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UML diagrams** | ❌ **None found**: No UML diagrams are present in the provided files. |
| **SQL Scripts** | ✅ **Available**: Several `.sql` files are included, containing queries for reports (`AcomResumo.sql`, `ListagemRemessas.sql`). These serve as a form of data documentation. |
| **Installation Scripts** | ✅ **Available**: Batch files (`Install.bat`, `UnInstall.bat`) are provided for installing the Windows Service, indicating a manual deployment process. |
| **Configuration Files** | ✅ **Available**: Multiple `.exe.config` files exist for different environments (DVP, QLD, PRD), documenting the connection strings and settings for each. |
| **Code comments** | 🟠 **Sparse**: Comments are present but are not comprehensive. They are mostly used for marking code sections or leaving short notes for developers. There is no formal XML documentation. |

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
This section provides a brief description of each metric used in the code analysis.

| Metric | Description | Typical values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lines of Code (LOC)** | Total number of executable lines of code, excluding comments and blank lines. A measure of size. | Lower is generally better. Classes > 500 LOC can be hard to maintain. |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Higher values indicate more complex code that is harder to test and maintain. | Methods should ideally be < 10. Values > 20 are considered high risk. |
| **Inheritance Depth** | The maximum length of a path from a class to its root in the inheritance hierarchy. Deep hierarchies can be complex and brittle. | A depth of < 4 is generally recommended. |
| **Classes Coupling** | Measures the number of other classes a single class is dependent upon. High coupling makes code harder to change and reuse. | Lower is better. A value < 10 is often a good target. |
| **Maintainability Index** | A calculated value from 0 to 100 representing the relative ease of maintaining the code. Higher values are better. | > 70: Good. 60-69: Moderate. < 60: Difficult to maintain. |
| **Code Deduplication** | The percentage of code that is duplicated across the codebase. High duplication increases maintenance effort and risk of bugs. | Should be kept as low as possible, ideally < 5%. |
| **Comments Density (%)** | The percentage of lines that are comments. Can indicate how well-documented the code is, though quality of comments matters more than quantity. | 15-25% is a common guideline, but varies greatly. |
| **Dead Code (%)** | The percentage of code that is unreachable or can be removed without affecting program behavior. | Should be 0%. Any value > 0 indicates code that needs to be cleaned up. |
| **Estimated Compilation Time (ms)** | An estimate of the time required to compile the project. Longer times can slow down development cycles. | Varies by project size. For a project of this size, a few seconds is typical. |

#### 4.5.2. Project metrics
The solution is composed of several project types, primarily Windows Forms applications, Windows Services, and class libraries.

#### 5.1.1. Nuget packages
No `packages.config` or `<PackageReference>` entries were found. Dependencies are managed via direct file references from a network share, which is a common practice in older enterprise applications.

## 6. Security and compliance
This section provides an analysis of the application's security posture based on the provided code.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application employs basic security mechanisms typical of older internal enterprise applications.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Inferred to be **Windows Authentication**. The `User` class is initialized with `System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`, suggesting the application uses the identity of the logged-in Windows user. |
| **Authorization** | **Custom Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. A simple check is performed against `UserLogged.m_iUserGroup` (e.g., `> 1`) to determine if a user has administrative privileges for sensitive actions like changing entity states. |
| **ASP.NET Membership Provider** | ❌ **Not Used**: This is a Windows Forms/Service application and does not use ASP.NET Membership. |
| **Data protection** | 🟠 **Limited**: Passwords appear to be handled as plaintext within the application logic, although the `AccaoParam.cs` class has a mechanism to mask a field named "passwd" in the UI, which is a positive sign. There is no evidence of modern data encryption at rest or in transit, beyond what the OS or SQL Server might provide by default. |
| **Audit logging** | ✅ **Implemented**: The `GenericLogNET` library and the custom `Alerta` system provide audit logging capabilities. Actions like manual state changes are logged as alerts. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were identified based on an analysis of the source code against the OWASP Top 10.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEC-001** | A01: Broken Access Control | Insufficient authorization checks. | Privileged actions are controlled by a simple integer check (`UserGroup > 1`). This is brittle and lacks granular control. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`, `UtilizadoresForm.cs` | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Implement a more robust, claims-based or feature-based authorization system. | [OWASP A01](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |
| **SEC-002** | A03: Injection | **High risk of SQL Injection**. | Raw SQL strings are built by concatenating user or system data directly into the query. Example: `sQuery += " where ALERT_ID=" + m_sALERT_ID;` in `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`, and potentially many other classes performing direct SQL calls. | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | **Immediately** refactor all data access to use parameterized queries or stored procedures with parameters. | [OWASP A03](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) |
| **SEC-003** | A05: Security Misconfiguration | Unsafe defaults and potential information disclosure. | The various `.exe.config` files contain database server names and database names for different environments. If not secured, this exposes infrastructure details. | `CIControlo.*.exe.config`, `CIServico.*.exe.config` | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Store secrets and connection strings in a secure, external configuration store like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault. | [OWASP A05](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) |
| **SEC-004** | A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components | Use of end-of-life framework and potentially vulnerable libraries. | The application targets .NET Framework 4.0, which is unsupported.

Audit and update all third-party libraries. | [OWASP A06](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/) |
| **SEC-005** | A07: Identification & Authentication Failures | Insecure handling of credentials. | The code in `AccaoParam.cs` checks for a field named "passwd", suggesting passwords might be stored or transmitted. Without seeing the storage mechanism, it must be assumed it is not using modern, salted hashing algorithms. | `AccaoParam.cs` and related data access for alerts/actions. | 🔴 High | 🟠 Medium | 🔴 High | Ensure all password storage uses a modern, strong, salted hashing algorithm like Argon2 or PBKDF2. | [OWASP A07](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/) |
| **SEC-006** | A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | Insufficient logging for security events. | While operational logging exists, there is no evidence of specific security-focused logging, such as failed access attempts, privilege escalations, or detailed audit trails for sensitive data access. | `GenericLogNET`, `Alerta` project. | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Implement dedicated security logging for all authentication, authorization, and data access events. | [OWASP A09](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/) |

## 13. Modernization strategy
This section outlines potential modernization strategies for the application, considering its current state and technological debt.

### 13.1. Modernization strategy comparison
Three strategies are compared, ranging from a minimal upgrade to a complete refactor.

| Strategy | Description | Complexity | Development time estimate | Functional testing time estimate | Infrastructure time estimate | Deployment time estimate | Total time estimate | Cost estimate | Risk | Long-term fit | Time-to-market | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)** | Upgrade all projects to .NET Framework 4.8.1, update dependencies, and upgrade the on-premises SQL Server to a supported version (e.g., 2019/2022). | 🟠 Medium | 3-5 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 11-18 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟢 Low | 🔴 Low | 🟢 Fast | ✅ Quickest way to get on a supported runtime.<br>✅ Low risk of functional regressions. | ❌ Does not address architectural flaws.<br>❌ Remains a monolith on legacy technology.<br>❌ Scalability and maintainability issues persist. |
| **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)** | Rehost the application and database to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure VMs and Azure SQL Database). Upgrade projects to .NET Framework 4.8.1. | 🟠 Medium | 3-5 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 14-21 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | ✅ Benefits from cloud infrastructure (reliability, backups).<br>✅ First step towards cloud-native. | ❌ Still a monolith.<br>❌ Not optimized for the cloud (higher running costs).<br>❌ Does not solve core architectural issues. |
| **Complete Refactor** | Re-architect the application to be cloud-native. Rewrite the UI as a web application (e.g., Blazor/ASP.NET), decompose the service into .NET 6+ microservices, and use a modern data access layer (EF Core). | 🔴 High | 9-12 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 21-29 weeks | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🟢 High | 🔴 Slow | ✅ Addresses all technical debt.<br>✅ Cloud-native, scalable, and maintainable.<br>✅ Enables modern DevOps practices. | ❌ Highest cost, time, and risk.<br>❌ Requires significant developer expertise and testing effort. |

### 13.2. Recommendation
Based on the significant technical debt, security vulnerabilities (SQL Injection), and use of end-of-life technology, a simple "Lift and Shift" is insufficient for long-term viability.

**The recommended strategy is a phased Refactor.**

A phased approach mitigates the risk of a full rewrite. The initial phase should focus on the most critical parts:
1.  **Phase 1 (Stabilize & Secure):** Perform a "Lift and Shift" to get the application onto .NET Framework 4.8.1 and a supported SQL Server version. **Crucially, this phase must include refactoring all data access code to eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities.** This immediately reduces the highest security risk.
2.  **Phase 2 (Decompose & Modernize):** Begin strangling the monolith. Identify bounded contexts (e.g., File Ingestion, Alerting) and rewrite them as separate .NET 6+ microservices. Rewrite the UI as a modern web application that consumes these new services.

This approach delivers immediate security and supportability benefits while providing a clear path to a modern, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

#### 13.2.1. Step-by-step plan
This plan outlines the steps for the recommended phased refactoring strategy.

**Phase 1: Stabilize & Secure (Lift and Shift)**

| Step | Task | Description | Technologies | Estimated Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | **Environment Setup** | Prepare new on-premises or cloud servers with a supported OS and SQL Server version (e.g., Windows Server 2019, SQL Server 2022). | Windows Server, SQL Server | 2 weeks |
| **1.2** | **Framework Upgrade** | Open the solution in a modern Visual Studio version. Retarget all projects to .NET Framework 4.8.1. | Visual Studio, .NET 4.8.1 | 1 week |
| **1.3** | **Dependency Audit** | Audit all third-party libraries (`GenericNet`, `NBIISNET`, `CrystalDecisions`). Find modern equivalents or ensure they are compatible with .NET 4.8.1. | - | 1 week |
| **1.4** | **SQL Injection Remediation** | **(CRITICAL)** Systematically find all instances of raw SQL concatenation and refactor them to use parameterized queries (`SqlParameter`). | C#, ADO.NET | 3-4 weeks |
| **1.5** | **Testing** | Perform full regression testing to ensure no functionality was broken during the upgrade and remediation. | Manual & Automated | 3-5 weeks |
| **1.6** | **Deployment** | Deploy the upgraded application and migrated database to the new environment. | Manual Scripts / CI-CD | 1 week |

**Phase 2: Decompose & Modernize (Refactor)**

| Step | Task | Description | Technologies | Estimated Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | **Identify First Microservice** | Choose a well-isolated component to extract first. `CIFicheiro` (File Processing) is a good candidate as it's triggered by an external event. | - | 1 week |
| **2.2** | **Develop New Service** | Create a new .NET 6+ Worker Service to handle file parsing. Implement its logic using modern practices and EF Core for data access. | .NET 6, EF Core | 3-4 weeks |
| **2.3** | **Web UI Rewrite** | Begin rewriting the user-facing parts as a Blazor Server or ASP.NET Core MVC application. Start with the most critical monitoring screens. | Blazor / ASP.NET Core | 4-6 weeks |
| **2.4** | **Integrate & Deploy** | Deploy the new microservice (e.g., in a container) and the new web UI. Run the new and old systems in parallel if possible. | Docker, Azure App Service | 2 weeks |
| **2.5** | **Iterate** | Continue identifying and extracting components (e.g., `CIServAlertas`, `CIServRemessas`) into new microservices, gradually phasing out the old Windows Service and Forms application. | .NET 6+, etc. | Ongoing |

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section evaluates the application's strategic value and recommends a course of action based on the TIME and 6R models.

| Classification | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification** | **Invest/Migrate**: The application provides high business value by handling core financial processes. However, its technical quality is very low due to its monolithic architecture, security vulnerabilities, and reliance on obsolete technology. It cannot be tolerated in its current state due to the high risk. Therefore, the strategy should be to **migrate** its functionality to a modern platform by investing in a **refactor** or **rebuild** effort. |
| **6R Classification** | **Refactor / Re-architect**: <br>- **Retain**: Not viable due to critical security risks and unsupported technology. <br>- **Retire/Replace**: Unlikely, as the application seems to handle specific, custom business logic for "Grupo Caixa Geral de Depósitos". A commercial off-the-shelf product may not fit. <br>- **Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**: A poor choice as it moves the technical debt and security risks to the cloud without solving them. <br>- **Replatform**: A possible intermediate step (e.g., moving to .NET 4.8.1 and Azure SQL) but does not address the core architectural issues. <br>- **Refactor/Re-architect**: This is the most appropriate strategy. It involves significantly altering the existing codebase to move to a modern, cloud-native architecture (e.g., microservices on .NET 6+), which aligns with the "Invest/Migrate" TIME classification. |

This application analysis was performed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI enhances the process, it may still produce inaccuracies, and all results should be carefully reviewed.
