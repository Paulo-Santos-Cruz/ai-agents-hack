## Markdown Formatting Rules (mandatory)
When writing Markdown documents, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure consistency and readability:
- Use **headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content hierarchically.
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for lists.
- Use **tables** where appropriate (e.g., for metrics, dependencies).
- Wrap any code examples in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Use **consistent indentation** and clear formatting throughout.
- Follow clean, simple structure as used in professional technical documentation.
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms or concepts.
- Use **italics** for emphasis on specific terms or concepts.
- Use **links** for references to external documentation or resources.
- Use **inline code** formatting for specific terms or commands (e.g., `Get-Process`).
- Use symbols for pros and cons, e.g., ‚úÖ for pros and ‚ùå for cons.
- Use symbols for impact, e.g., üî¥ for high impact, üü† for medium impact, üü¢ for low impact, writing also the impact as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for risk, e.g., üî¥ for high risk, üü† for medium risk, üü¢ for low risk, writing also the risk as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for long-term fit, e.g., üî¥ for low long-term fit, üü† for medium long-term fit, üü¢ for high long-term fit, writing also the long-term fit as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for priority, e.g., üî¥ for high priority, üü† for medium priority, üü¢ for low priority, writing also the priority as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for severity, e.g., üî¥ for high severity, üü† for medium severity, üü¢ for low severity, writing also the severity as text after the symbol
- **CRITICAL: Severity icon consistency (mandatory)** - NEVER mix these symbols: High/Critical=üî¥ ONLY, Medium=üü† ONLY, Low=üü¢ ONLY. Each severity level must use its exact designated icon throughout the entire document without exception.
- Use symbols for complexity, e.g., üî¥ for high complexity, üü† for medium complexity, üü¢ for low complexity, writing also the complexity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for cost, e.g., üî¥ for high cost, üü† for medium cost, üü¢ for low cost, writing also the cost as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for support, e.g., ‚úÖ for supported, ‚ùå for not supported, writing also the support status as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for used in the application, e.g., ‚úÖ for used in the application, ‚ùå for not used in the application,‚ùî for likely, writing also the used in the application status as text after the symbol¬†¬†

## Generic Mermaid Diagram Rules (mandatory)
When including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown document, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
- **üö® CRITICAL FLOWCHART EDGE SYNTAX WARNING: NEVER use `A --> B: "label"` syntax in flowcharts - this is INVALID and will cause parsing errors. Always use `A -->|"label"| B` instead.**
- **Only the following Mermaid diagram types are allowed**: 'flowchart TD', 'sequenceDiagram','classDiagram','stateDiagram','erDiagram','gantt','journey','gitGraph','pie','mindmap','zenuml','quadrantChart','xychart-beta','block-beta','packet-beta','treemap-beta'.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x (Starts with "Figure X - " (for example, "Figure 1 - ")).
- The Mermaid diagram **must be placed exactly where it is referenced** in the document. Do not place it at the end or elsewhere
- If any node label contains **HTML tags** such as `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc., the **entire label must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`)**.
   - Correct example:
     `step1["Start <b>Process</b>"]`
   - Incorrect example:
     `step1[Start <b>Process</b>]`
     (This will break rendering and must be avoided.)
- Always **validate the Mermaid syntax** before including the diagram. The syntax must be correct to ensure the diagram renders properly in the final Markdown output. If validation is not possible, use only syntax known to be 100% correct.
- **Final checklist before including a Mermaid diagram:**
 - Validate Mermaid syntax to ensure no errors.
 - Enclose any HTML-containing node labels in double quotes.
 - Place the diagram exactly where referenced.
 - Immediately follow the diagram with a properly formatted caption starting with "Figure X -"
 - Make sure the caption is visually secondary and centered.
 - Use the following rules for all Mermaid diagram types (`flowchart`, `classDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, etc.) to ensure valid, portable, and compatible diagrams.

### General Unsupported Syntax (Do Not Use)

- Do not use special characters in identifiers or class names:
  - Avoid: \*, #, /, <>, {}, &, @, \$, \[]
  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores

- Do not use smart quotes:
  - Avoid: ‚Äú ‚Äù, ‚Äò ‚Äô
  - Use plain double or single quotes: "text", 'text'

- Do not use emojis or non-ASCII characters in any labels or class names

- Do not use HTML or Markdown formatting inside labels:
  - Avoid: <b>bold</b>, **bold**, fa\:icon, etc.

- Do not use empty curly braces:
  - Invalid: `class Foo {}` (if no members are defined)
  - Valid: `class Foo` for empty classes

- Do not leave special characters or spaces in labels without wrapping them in quotes:
  - Invalid: A\[User/Admin]
  - Valid: A\["User/Admin"]

- Do not reference undefined nodes or classes in relationships:
  - All identifiers used in edges (A --> B) must be declared

- Do not use multiple edge definitions on a single line:
  - Invalid: A --> B --> C
  - Valid: one edge per line

- Do not use nested or double curly braces like `{{`:
  - Only use `B{"Decision"}` where decision nodes are allowed

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: PascalCase or snake\_case

- Quote all labels containing:

  * Spaces: "Back Office"
  * Special characters: "Read/Write"
  * Dashes or dots: "Version 1.0"

- Format diagrams using fenced code blocks:

  ````
  ```mermaid
  diagramType
  ...
  ````

  ```
  ```

- Use `note` syntax correctly when supported:

  ```
  note for ClassName "Description here"
  ```

- Validate diagrams in your rendering context (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor)

### Diagram-Specific Rules

#### flowchart

- Use square brackets for nodes: A\["Label"]
- Use curly braces only for decisions: B{"Yes or No?"}
- Edges must use -->, <--, --- (no mixing)
- Do not use the class keyword

#### classDiagram

- Use `class ClassName {}` only when listing attributes or methods
- Do not use symbols like "\*" for class names
- For "everything" or "all" access, define a placeholder class such as AllEntities
- Use these for relationships:
  - Inheritance: Child <|-- Parent
  - Association: A ..> B : "Label"

#### sequenceDiagram

- Define all participants before referencing them
- Use only supported message arrows: ->>, -->> etc.
- Loops and conditions must follow valid syntax

### Summary

- Only use plain ASCII characters
- Avoid all special formatting, smart symbols, and undeclared references
- Always test your diagram using a Mermaid-compatible renderer

## Mermaid flowchart TD Diagram Rules (mandatory)
Generate Mermaid flowchart TD diagram with the following constraints:
- No line breaks inside node labels ‚Äî keep all labels on a single line.
- Wrap all node labels in double quotes, especially if they contain special characters (e.g., parentheses, slashes, or commas).
- Avoid using {} to define nodes unless you are explicitly defining a decision node. If used, it must be in the form B{"Decision"} (not {{).
- Use only valid Mermaid syntax:
 - Nodes: "Label" in square brackets: A["Text"]
 - Decision nodes: curly braces with quoted text: B{"Yes or No?"}
 - Terminators or databases: use round or cylinder notation with "Text" inside
 - No indentation is required ‚Äî use one line per statement, no tabs
 - Use plain ASCII characters ‚Äî avoid smart quotes (‚Äú‚Äù) or non-breaking spaces
 - Use only plain text in node labels ‚Äî do not include any icons, HTML, Font Awesome (fa:), or special syntax
 - If grouping nodes with subgraph, ensure the subgraph name is a single word or quoted string
 - Do not use emoji, Markdown, or HTML inside labels
 - **CRITICAL EDGE SYNTAX RULES:**
   - **NEVER use this invalid syntax: `A --> B: "label text"`** - This will cause parsing errors
   - **ALWAYS use one of these valid edge syntaxes:**
     - Simple edge: `A --> B` (no label)
     - Edge with label: `A -->|"label text"| B` (label enclosed in |"text"|)
     - Alternative edge with label: `A -.->|"label text"| B` (dotted line with label)
   - **Examples:**
     - ‚ùå INVALID: `A --> B: "Provides input for"`
     - ‚úÖ VALID: `A -->|"Provides input for"| B`
     - ‚úÖ VALID: `A --> B` (if no label needed)
   - Format all edges with --> or <-->, one per line
   - Never use colon (:) syntax for edge labels in flowcharts

 ## Mermaid classDiagram Diagram Rules (mandatory)
Generate Mermaid classDiagram diagram with the following constraints:
 - Use **valid Mermaid `classDiagram` syntax** only ‚Äî do **not** mix with flowchart or sequence diagram syntax.
 - **Class names must be valid identifiers**:
  - * Use only letters, numbers, and underscores.
  - * Avoid special characters such as `"*"`, `/`, `&`, `<>`, `#`, etc.
-  To indicate "all entities" or similar concepts, use a **valid placeholder class name** like `AllEntities` instead of `"*"`.
- If a class has no attributes or methods, define it as:

  ```
  class ClassName
  ```

  Not:

  ```
  class ClassName {}
  ```
* If a class has attributes or methods, define it like this:

  ```
  class ClassName {
      +attribute: Type
      +methodName()
  }
  ```
- **Do not use curly braces (`{}`)** for class definitions unless they contain properly formatted members.
- **Avoid empty or malformed bodies** like `class Foo { <> }` ‚Äî these will cause syntax errors.
- Use only **plain ASCII characters** ‚Äî avoid smart quotes (‚Äú ‚Äù), emojis, or non-breaking spaces.
- **Do not include HTML, Markdown, icons, or special formatting** in labels or class names.
- Each **relationship line** must use valid Mermaid syntax and reference previously defined classes:
  - Inheritance: `Child <|-- Parent`
  - Association: `A ..> B : "Label"`
- Use `note for ClassName "Text"` for annotations. The class must exist.
. Do not duplicate class declarations.
- One statement per line ‚Äî indentation is optional.
- Always **close string labels with plain double quotes** (`"`), not smart quotes.

## Table format rules (mandatory)
When creating tables in Markdown, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
**When is explicit asked to use table format you MUST use table format**.

For every single user task flow, you must generate a new subsection by following this template precisely. Use sequential numbering (2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.8.3, etc.).

**Template for each user task flow:**

#### 2.9.[Number]. User Task Flow: [User Task Flow Name]
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the [User Task Flow Name], including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made, using a table format.

- **Step** (e.g., Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc.)
- **Description** (e.g., Brief description of the step, e.g., "The user logs into the application to access their dashboard.")
- **User Role** (e.g., User Role involved in the step, e.g., "Data Engineer", "System Administrator", "End User")
- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities involved in the step, e.g., "[PrimaryBusinessObject], [Transaction], [Report].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made for the Step)

Include a Mermaid applicable diagram to visualize this specific user task flow and its relationships or steps.

**Crucially, if 3 user task flows are detected in the summary, you MUST generate sections 2.8.1, 2.8.2, AND 2.8.3. Do not stop after the first one.**

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes any system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction, such as nightly jobs, scheduled reports, or data synchronization tasks, using table format.

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Process Name** (e.g., Nightly Data Aggregation, Inbound File Watcher, etc.)
- **Trigger / Schedule** (e.g., Cron expression, Event-based trigger, etc.)
- **Purpose** (e.g., Brief description of the process's purpose, e.g., "Pre-calculates daily summary data to speed up reporting.")
- **Key Actions** (e.g., List of key actions performed by the process, e.g., "Read all of day's [Transaction] records, Calculate SUM, AVG, COUNT, Write results to [DailySummary] table.")
- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities involved in the process, e.g., "[Transaction], [DailySummary].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made about the process, e.g., "Assumes that the process runs on a nightly schedule to aggregate data. Inferred from method names like `RunScheduledJob`, `ExecuteNightlyProcess`, or `TriggerDataSync` in service classes or controllers.")

##Critical instructions for these sections (Functional overview section an subsections):
- Rule 1: Source Code is the Only Truth. Your analysis **MUST** be based exclusively and entirely on a deep-dive analysis of provided source code. Do **NOT** invent features or use external knowledge about common business practices unless it is a direct and logical inference from a code artifact. Every piece of functionality you document must be traceable to a class, method, UI element, database query, or data model found in the code.
- Rule 2: Explicitly State All Assumptions. When the code's intent is ambiguous (e.g., a poorly named variable or function), you **MUST** make a logical inference and clearly label it as an "Assumption."
 - Example:** In the 'Assumptions' column, write: *"Assuming the boolean flag `is_mgr` in the `User` class denotes a 'Manager' role with supervisory capabilities."
-Rule 3: Functional "What," Not Technical "How."* You must relentlessly translate technical implementation details into business-centric functional descriptions. Your audience is business stakeholders and new developers who need to understand purpose, not implementation.
- **BAD (Technical):** "The `btnSubmit_Click` event handler calls the `SaveOrderToDB` method, which executes an `INSERT` SQL statement."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The 'Submit New Order' feature allows a user to persist the order details into the system's database."
 - **BAD (Technical):** "The system uses a `List<Customer>` object to hold the data."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The system manages a collection of 'Customer' data entities."
- Rule 4: Strict Adherence to the Template. You **MUST** follow the provided Markdown template precisely, section by section. Populate all tables as requested. Generate the specified Mermaid diagrams for each section where they apply, ensuring the syntax is correct and enclosed in proper Markdown code fences (e.g., ` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
- Rule 5: Be Universal and Reusable. Your final output should use generic placeholders (e.g., `[PrimaryBusinessObject]`, `[User Role]`, `[Process Name]`) as instructed in the template. This ensures the document you generate serves as a perfect, reusable template for analyzing any application in the future.
- Do not begin generating the response until you have fully understood these five critical rules.

- **Comments density (%)** (e.g., Percentage of comments in the project, calculated in the code analysis with the value of the metric e.g. 100%)
- **Dead code (%)** (e.g., Percentage of dead code in the project, calculated in the code analysis with the value of the metric e.g. 100%)
- **Estimated compilation time (ms)** (e.g., Estimated compilation time of the project, calculated in the code analysis with the value of the metric in milliseconds e.g. 100ms)

##Instructions:
- *All* projects must be included in the table, not just the main ones or a subset.
- *All* metrics must be included in the table, not just a subset.
- Include always the value of the metric, e.g.,0, 100, 100%, 100ms, etc. N/A is not an acceptable value. 0 when we don't have the metric available is not an acceptable value. In these cases you have to reanalyze the code to get the metric value or remove the metric from the table.

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

Include table with a brief description of each one of the metrics used in the code analysis, e.g., Lines of Code (LOC), Ciclomatic complexity, Inheritance depth, Classes coupling, Maintainability index, etc., with the following columns:
- **Metric** (e.g., Lines of Code, Ciclomatic complexity, Inheritance depth, Classes coupling, Maintainability index, etc.)
- **Description** (e.g., Brief description of the metric, e.g., Lines of Code (LOC) is the total number of lines of code in the project, excluding comments and blank lines, Ciclomatic complexity is a measure of the complexity of the code, Inheritance depth is the average depth of inheritance in the project, Classes coupling is the average coupling between classes in the project, Maintainability index is a measure of the maintainability of the code, etc.)
- **Typical values** (e.g., Typical values for the metric, e.g., Lines of Code (LOC) should be less than 1000, Ciclomatic complexity should be less than 10, Inheritance depth should be less than 3, Classes coupling should be less than 5, Maintainability index should be greater than 70, etc.)

You have to be very rigorous when calculating these metrics, they cannot be approximations, they have to be properly calculated.

##Instructions for this section:
 - Given the detailed analysis of this .NET application, provide three complete modernization strategies in a table format, and the step-by-step plan, also in a table format, to implement them.
 - Strategy 1: **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)**, maintaining the application current deployment model (e.g. on-premises) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 2: **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**, rehosting the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 3: **Refactor** (also known as "Repackage"), refactoring the application to use modern design patterns, architectures and technologies, e.g., microservices, serverless, cloud-native, etc, evolving the application to the latest .NET version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc.
 - Provide a table with comparison between the three strategies, including the pros and cons of each one with the following columns:
  - **Factor** (e.g., Complexity, Cost (Development), Cost (Functional testing), Cost (Infrastructure), Time to implement (Development), Time to test (Functional testing), Time to implement (Infrastructure), Risk, Long-term fit, time-to-market, etc.)
  - **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)
  - **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting)
  - **Complete Refactor** (Refactor)

- The complexity and the time estimate to implement each strategy depends on the following factors which are only related with the development effort and not with the infrastructure or deployment effort:
 - Complexity low - the application is small, with few dependencies and a simple architecture = 1-2 weeks
 - Complexity medium - the application is medium-sized, with some dependencies and a moderate architecture = 3-5 weeks
 - Complexity high - the application is large, with many dependencies and a complex architecture = 6-8 weeks
 - Complexity very high - the application is very large, with many dependencies and a very complex architecture = 9-12 weeks

 ##Instruction: You must separate the development effort from the infrastructure or deployment effort, so the complexity and time estimate must be only related with the development effort.

## 2. Functional overview
This section provides a high-level functional decomposition of the application, using table format. It identifies the major, distinct functional blocks or modules as inferred from the code's high-level structure (e.g., top-level namespaces, solution folders, primary class groups). This overview serves as a map to the application's core responsibilities.

### 2.1. Executive summary
This section provides a high-level summary of the application's primary purpose and its core function from a business or operational perspective, using table format. The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | To automate and monitor the processing of financial remittances (cheques) from various sources, including bank branches (`Balc√£o`) and other systems (`GCAA`). |
| **Core Function** | The application functions as a back-office processing engine. It ingests remittance data, processes it in tranches, manages document states, handles reversals (`Estornos`), and generates alerts for operational staff. A Windows Forms-based control panel allows users to monitor these activities, intervene manually when errors occur, and configure system parameters. |
| **Key Inferences** | - The presence of `CIServico.csproj` indicates a continuously running background service for automated processing.<br>- The `CIControlo.csproj` and `CIActividades.csproj` projects provide a rich client interface for operators to oversee and manage the system.<br>- The system is designed to handle different types of remittances and has specific logic for reversals and error handling (`CIDepositoErro.csproj`).<br>- Integration with external systems is evident through file processing (`ACOM`, `ENVM`) and web services (`MDIWebTransmCI.vbproj`). |

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure, using table format. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application. The decomposition is based on the organization of namespaces, classes, and methods, as well as the relationships between them.

| Functional Area / Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Interaction & Presentation** | Manages user interfaces, handles user input, and renders data. This module is the primary interface between the user and the system's core logic. It is implemented as a Windows Forms application. |
| **Core Process Execution Engine** | A Windows Service that orchestrates background tasks. It is responsible for triggering remittance processing, alert handling, and file ingestion on a schedule or in response to events. |
| **Remittance & Document Processing** | The heart of the application, containing the business logic for processing remittances. This includes validating data, grouping documents into tranches, updating statuses, and handling reversals. |
| **Alerting & Notification** | A dedicated module for generating and dispatching system alerts. It defines various alert conditions (e.g., processing errors, delays) and the actions to be taken (e.g., send email, log to DB). |
| **Configuration & User Management** | Provides services for managing application settings, database connections, and user permissions. It centralizes configuration for different deployment environments. |
| **Data Persistence & Management** | Handles all interactions with the backend database. This includes reading and writing data entities like Remittances, Documents, and Alerts using direct SQL queries. |
| **External System Integration** | Manages communication with external systems. This includes parsing incoming files (ACOM, ENVM) and consuming external web services for tasks like document insertion. |

### 2.7. Business process workflows
This section describes and visualizes critical end-to-end processes, showing how different user roles and system features interact, using table format.

| Process | Description | Key Steps | User Roles Involved | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Remittance Processing** | A comprehensive workflow that outlines the steps involved in processing remittance data from ingestion to final clearing. | 1. Open Remittance<br>2. Process Documents<br>3. Group into Tranches<br>4. Send Tranches<br>5. Update Final Status | System Service, Standard Operator (monitoring) | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Tranche` | Assumes a linear, state-based progression. Inferred from methods like `ProcessarRemessas` and status change logic. |
| **Alert Generation and Handling** | The workflow for creating, dispatching, and resolving system alerts. | 1. Event/Error Occurs<br>2. Alert is Generated (DB Insert)<br>3. Alert Service picks up pending alert<br>4. Action is Executed (e.g., Email)<br>5. Alert status is updated to Processed. | System Service, Administrator | `Alerta`, `SituacaoAccao`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `CIServAlertas` project. Assumes a polling mechanism for pending alerts. |
| **Manual Error Intervention** | A user-driven workflow to correct a remittance or document that has failed during automated processing. | 1. Operator identifies an error via UI<br>2. Operator selects the failed entity<br>3. Operator changes the status (e.g., to 'Pending Re-processing')<br>4. System Service re-processes the entity. | Administrator, Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `MudarEstadoForm` and related event handlers in the UI projects. |

#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Standard Remittance Processing
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Standard Remittance Processing workflow, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made, using a table format.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Open Remittance** | A new remittance is received and its status is set to 'Open' or 'Pending'. This could be from a file drop or an API call. | System Service | `Remessa` | Assumes an initial state where the remittance is ready for processing. |
| **2. Process Documents** | The `CIServico` background service picks up the remittance. It iterates through each document, performing validation and data extraction. | System Service | `Documento` | Inferred from `ProcessaRemessa` method. Assumes document-level validation logic exists. |
| **3. Group into Tranches** | Validated documents are grouped into tranches based on system rules (e.g., `MaxDocsTranche` parameter). Each tranche is created as a new entity. | System Service | `Tranche` | Inferred from `CriarTranche` method. |
| **4. Send Tranches** | The tranches are prepared for sending to an external system (e.g., clearing house). The status is updated to 'Sent'. | System Service | `Tranche` | Assumes an integration point exists for sending the data, likely via a file or web service. |
| **5. Update Final Status** | After receiving confirmation from the external system, the final status of the remittance and its documents is updated (e.g., 'Processed', 'Error'). | System Service | `Remessa`, `Documento` | Inferred from the presence of various status fields and error-handling logic. |

#### 2.7.2. Workflow: Alert Generation and Handling
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Alert Generation and Handling workflow, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made, using a table format.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Event/Error Occurs** | An error happens during processing (e.g., SQL error, validation failure). | System Service | `Remessa`, `Documento` | A `try-catch` block or a specific business rule detects the error. |
| **2. Alert is Generated** | A new record is inserted into the `ALERTA` table with details about the event and a 'Pending' status. | System Service | `Alerta` | The `EnviarAlertaSituacao` method is called with a specific situation ID. |
| **3. Alert Service Polls** | The `CIServAlertas` service periodically queries the database for alerts with a 'Pending' status. | System Service | `Alerta` | Inferred from the `AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar` method. |
| **4. Action is Executed** | The service identifies the action linked to the alert's situation (e.g., Email) and executes it using the configured parameters. | System Service | `Accao`, `AccaoParam` | The `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccao` method dispatches the task based on `enuTipoAccao`. |
| **5. Alert Status Updated** | The alert's status is updated to 'Processed' or 'Error' in the `ALERTA_ALERTA_ACCAO` table. | System Service | `AlertaSituacaoAccao` | Inferred from the `SetProcessado` and `SetErroProcessamento` methods. |

### 2.8. System inputs & outputs (interfaces)
This section catalogs all identified points where data enters or leaves the application boundary, using table format.

| Type | Name / Description | Data Formats | Data Source / Sink | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | **File Ingestion (ENVM, ACOM)** | Fixed-width text files | Monitored file system directory | A file watcher service (`CIServico`) is inferred to be listening in paths defined in the configuration. Inferred from `CIFicheiro` project. |
| **Input** | **User Interaction** | User input via UI controls | Windows Forms application (`CIControlo`) | Operators use the UI to filter data, trigger actions, and manage system configuration. |
| **Output** | **Database Writes** | SQL | Microsoft SQL Server | All processed data, statuses, and logs are persisted in the central database. |
| **Output** | **Alert Notifications** | Email, SMS, Log File, Event Viewer | External SMTP server, SMS gateway, file system, Windows Event Log | The `Alerta` module dispatches notifications to various sinks based on configuration. |
| **Data Flow** | **Primary Internal Flow** | In-memory objects (e.g., `Remessa`, `Documento`) | Application Memory -> Database | Data is read from the database, processed by business logic in service classes, and the results are written back to the database. |
| **Data Flow** | **Web Service Call** | SOAP/XML | External Web Service (`waiaccesstuInsertDoc`) | The `MDIWebTransmCI` project makes calls to an external service to insert document data. |

### 2.9. User Task Flows
This section describes the typical path a user takes through the application to achieve a high-level objective, linking multiple features together, using table format.

| Task Flow | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monitor Daily Processing** | An operator logs in to review the status of the day's remittances, check for errors, and ensure all batches have completed successfully. | Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Assumes the operator's primary goal is to ensure the smooth execution of automated processes. |
| **Resolve a Failed Remittance** | An administrator identifies a remittance in an error state, investigates the cause by viewing its documents, manually changes its state to force a re-run, and confirms its successful completion. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Activity_Change` | This flow involves multiple steps: investigation, manual intervention, and verification. |

#### 2.9.1. User Task Flow: Resolve a Failed Remittance
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Resolve a Failed Remittance, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made, using a table format.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identify Error** | The Administrator opens the `ActividadesForm` and filters for remittances with an 'Error' status. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The UI provides filtering capabilities to easily find problematic items. |
| **2. Investigate Cause** | The Administrator double-clicks the failed remittance to view its tranches and documents, looking for specific error messages or data anomalies. | Administrator | `Tranche`, `Documento` | The UI allows drilling down from a high-level entity to its constituent parts. |
| **3. View Document Image** | If a specific document is suspect, the Administrator double-clicks it to open the `ImagemBalcaoForm` and visually inspect the scanned cheque. | Administrator | `Imagem` | The system has access to the image repository and can retrieve images based on a document ID. |
| **4. Manual State Change** | After identifying the issue (e.g., a temporary network glitch), the Administrator right-clicks the remittance and selects "Mudar Estado" to reset its status to 'Pending'. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Activity_Change` | Assumes the user has the necessary privileges, which is checked by the `ConfirmaPrivilegios` method. |
| **5. Verify Re-processing** | The Administrator refreshes the view to confirm that the `CIServico` has picked up the remittance again and successfully processed it. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The system's background service is capable of re-processing items that are put back into a pending state. |

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes any system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction, such as nightly jobs, scheduled reports, or data synchronization tasks, using table format.

| Process Name | Trigger / Schedule | Purpose | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Job** | Timer-based (every few minutes) | To automatically process incoming remittances that are in a 'Pending' state. | 1. Query for pending remittances.<br>2. For each remittance, validate and process its documents.<br>3. Create and send tranches.<br>4. Update final status. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from `CIServico.cs` and `CIServRemessas.cs`. The service runs continuously, polling for work. |
| **Alert Processing Job** | Timer-based (every few minutes) | To automatically handle system alerts by executing their associated actions. | 1. Query for pending alerts.<br>2. For each alert, identify the action (e.g., email).<br>3. Execute the action.<br>4. Update alert status. | `Alerta`, `Accao` | Inferred from `CIServAlertas.cs`. This runs in parallel with remittance processing. |
| **File Ingestion Service** | File System Watcher or Timer-based poll | To automatically import data from `ENVM` and `ACOM` files dropped into a monitored directory. | 1. Detect new file.<br>2. Parse file line by line.<br>3. Insert data into staging tables.<br>4. Move processed file to a backup location. | `Ficheiro`, `Lote` | Inferred from the `CIFicheiro` project and its file-handling logic. |
| **Stale Remittance Check** | Scheduled (likely daily) | To generate alerts for remittances that have been in an intermediate state for too long. | 1. Query for remittances in states like 'Processing' for more than `MaxHorasEsperaRemessaCI`.<br>2. Generate a specific alert for each stale remittance. | `Remessa`, `Alerta` | Inferred from the configuration parameter `MaxHorasEsperaRemessaCI` and the general purpose of the alerting module. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section describes the architectural patterns, design principles, and overall structure of the application as inferred from the source code.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a traditional, monolithic N-Tier architecture, with some elements of specific design patterns within its layers.

| Pattern Type | Patterns Identified & Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture pattern** | **N-Tier Monolith**: The application is structured into distinct layers for presentation, business logic, and data access, but all components are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit (or a set of closely related executables). |
| **Architectural patterns** | **Windows Forms (UI)**: The presentation layer is built using Windows Forms, a standard for desktop applications in the .NET Framework era.<br>**Service-Oriented (Internal)**: The logic is broken down into "services" (`CIServRemessas`, `CIServAlertas`), but these are class libraries within the monolith, not independent microservices. |
| **Creational patterns** | **Singleton (Inferred)**: `CIConfigGlobalParameters` appears to be used as a singleton-like object, passed around to provide global access to configuration and database connections. |
| **Structural patterns** | Not explicitly identified, but the use of interfaces like `CIComumInterface` suggests a move towards decoupling, though its implementation may be inconsistent. |
| **Behavioral patterns** | **Observer (Inferred)**: The alerting system, where events (subjects) trigger actions (observers), loosely follows the Observer pattern. |
| **Domain-driven design (DDD) patterns** | **Repository (Partial/Anemic)**: Classes like `ServRemessa` and `ServAlerta` act as repositories by encapsulating data access logic, but they operate on data entities that appear to be simple data containers (anemic domain model) rather than rich domain objects. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application's architecture is characteristic of systems built with .NET Framework 4.0, emphasizing a layered approach with direct database communication.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | **3-Tier Layered Architecture**: <br>1. **Presentation Layer**: `CIControlo.csproj`, `CIActividades.csproj` (Windows Forms).<br>2. **Business Logic Layer**: `CIServico.csproj`, `CIServRemessas.csproj`, `CIServAlertas.csproj`.<br>3. **Data Access Layer**: Implicitly defined within business logic classes through direct `SqlDataReader` and raw SQL queries. There is no dedicated, separate data access layer project. |
| **Dependency flow** | **Top-Down**: Dependencies flow from the UI/Service layer down to the business logic and then directly to the database. Shared libraries like `CIConfigGlobalParameters` are referenced across multiple layers, creating some horizontal coupling. |
| **Bounded contexts** | Not formally defined. However, the project structure suggests informal bounded contexts: Remittance Processing, Alerting, Configuration, and User Interface. These are not strictly enforced and share the same database. |
| **Communication between contexts/services** | **Direct Method Calls**: As a monolith, components communicate via direct, in-process method calls. |
| **Use of dependency injection / IOC container** | ‚ùå **Not Supported**: Dependencies are manually instantiated (e.g., `new CIServRemessas.ServRemessa(this, m_oParameters)`). There is no evidence of an Inversion of Control (IoC) container. |

### 3.3. Key design patterns and principles applied
The codebase shows an application of some classic design principles, though adherence is not always strict.

| Principle | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID principles** | üü† **Partial Adherence**: <br>- **Single Responsibility**: Partially followed. Classes like `ServRemessa` handle multiple responsibilities (fetching data, processing, updating state).<br>- **Open/Closed**: Violated. Changing logic often requires modifying existing classes rather than extending them. |
| **DRY** | üü† **Medium Adherence**: Some code duplication is likely, especially in data access patterns (raw SQL queries). However, helper classes like `CIGlobalParameters` centralize some common functionalities. |
| **KISS** | üü¢ **High Adherence**: The code is straightforward and procedural, making individual methods relatively easy to understand, though the overall system coupling is high. |
| **YAGNI** | ‚ùî **Likely**: The code seems focused on the specific requirements of remittance processing, with little evidence of "gold plating" or speculative features. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | üü† **Partial Separation**: There is a clear separation between the background service (`CIServico`) and the UI (`CIControlo`), but the UI code contains business logic (e.g., `btnRemessasErro_Click` directly calling a stored procedure). The data access logic is mixed within business classes. |
| **Testability** | üü† **Medium**: The presence of a `CITestes` project is a positive sign. However, the lack of dependency injection and the tight coupling to `SqlConnection` and static helpers would make unit testing difficult without significant refactoring. |
| **Maintainability** | üî¥ **Low**: The use of an old framework, direct SQL queries embedded in code, and lack of dependency injection make the system hard to maintain and evolve. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
The application does not follow a formal Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.

| DDD Concept | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | üî¥ **Low Adoption**: The code is data-centric rather than domain-centric.<br>- **Entities**: Classes like `Remessa` and `Documento` are anemic data containers with properties but little to no behavior.<br>- **Repositories**: Partially implemented by service classes, but they don't abstract the data source effectively (still tied to SQL Server).<br>- **Aggregates/Value Objects**: Not used. |
| **Ubiquitous language** | üü† **Partially Present**: The code uses business terms like `Remessa` (Remittance), `Tranche`, `Balcao` (Branch), and `Estorno` (Reversal), indicating a shared language with the business domain. However, this is not consistently enforced. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | ‚ùå **Not Implemented**: The architecture is a classic N-Tier, not a clean/onion architecture typical of modern DDD. The core business logic is not isolated from infrastructure concerns like data access. |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application employs several common software patterns, primarily for data access and flow control.

| Pattern/Tactic | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Repository pattern** | üü† **Partially Implemented**: Service classes like `ServRemessa` act as repositories, centralizing data access for `Remessa` entities. However, they are not fully abstracted and expose implementation details (e.g., using `SqlDataReader` directly). |
| **Unit of Work pattern** | ‚ùå **Not Implemented**: Transactions are managed manually using `m_oParameters.BeginTrans`, `Commit`, and `RollBack`. There is no formal Unit of Work pattern to group operations. |
| **Factory pattern** | ‚ùå **Not Implemented**: Objects are created directly using the `new` keyword. |
| **Strategy pattern** | üü† **Partially Implemented**: The alert processing logic in `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccao` uses a `switch` statement on `enuTipoAccao` to delegate to different processing methods (`ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccaoMail`, `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccaoLogDB`). This resembles a basic, non-extensible implementation of the Strategy pattern. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
Cross-cutting concerns are handled through shared utility classes and manual implementation rather than AOP frameworks.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | Implemented via a custom `GenericLog` class. It provides methods like `GenLogRegistarAlerta` and `GenLogRegistarErro`, suggesting different log levels. |
| **Exception Handling** | Standard `try-catch` blocks are used throughout the application. Caught exceptions are often logged using `GenericLog` and/or displayed to the user via `MessageBox`. |
| **Configuration Management** | Centralized in the `CIConfigGlobalParameters` project. It reads settings from `.config` files and provides a global access point (`m_oParameters`) passed to most classes. |
| **Authentication** | Handled via the `User` class in `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. It appears to check user details against a database table (`VW_PASSWD_GROUP`). |
| **Authorization** | Implemented with simple, direct checks on the user's group ID (e.g., `if (m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup > 1)`). |

### 3.7. Deployment
The deployment architecture is typical of an on-premises Windows application from its era.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs microservices** | **Monolithic**: The application is a single, large, and tightly coupled system. |
| **Scalability design** | üî¥ **Low**: The application is not designed for horizontal scalability. Scaling would require vertically upgrading the server (more CPU/RAM). The direct database dependency and stateful nature of the UI are significant bottlenecks. |
| **Cloud-native design** | ‚ùå **Not Cloud-Native**: The application relies on on-premises infrastructure, including a specific database server and file paths (e.g., `\\sqc6001fas02\imagens\...`). It is not designed for cloud elasticity, containerization, or serverless execution. |
| **Containerization** | ‚ùå **Not Supported**: The application is not containerized and relies on a full Windows OS with the .NET Framework installed. |
| **Deployment model** | **On-premises**: Inferred from hardcoded server names (`sdc6001sql28`, `vpc6001sql111`) and the presence of `installutil` batch files for installing a Windows Service. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application has specific infrastructure dependencies that tie it to an on-premises environment.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | **Microsoft SQL Server**: The use of `SqlConnection` and server names like `SDC6001SQL28\S2K081` point to SQL Server. The application appears to use a single database for all its data. |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | **TIBCO (Inferred)**: A `ListView` column named `colTIBCOEstado` in `ActividadeBalcaoForm.Designer.cs` suggests an integration with a TIBCO messaging system, likely for asynchronous communication with other banking systems. |
| **External integrations** | - **File System**: The application monitors directories for incoming `ENVM` and `ACOM` files. It also writes log files.<br>- **Web Service**: The `MDIWebTransmCI` project consumes a SOAP web service at `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService`. |

### 3.9. Documentation artifacts
Based on the provided files, the available documentation is limited to what can be inferred from the code itself.

| Artifact Type | Availability & Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UML diagrams** | ‚ùå **Not Provided**: No UML diagrams were found in the source code. |
| **C4 model diagrams** | ‚ùå **Not Provided**: No C4 model diagrams were found. |
| **Architecture diagrams** | ‚ùå **Not Provided**: No formal architecture diagrams were found. |
| **API documentation** | üü† **Partially Available**: The `MDIWebTransmCI` project contains a WSDL file (`Insert_DocumentoMDIService.wsdl`) which serves as documentation for the consumed web service. There is no documentation for any APIs provided by the application itself. |
| **Readme or ADRs** | ‚ùå **Not Provided**: No README files or Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) were found. |

## 4. Technology stack and frameworks
This section details the specific technologies, libraries, and frameworks used to build and run the application.

### 4.1. Backend technologies
The backend is built on the classic .NET Framework stack.

| Aspect | Technology/Framework |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Programming Language(s)** | C#, VB.NET |
| **.NET Runtime(s)** | .NET Framework 4.0 |
| **Runtime architecture** | AnyCPU |

| **Frontend framework(s)** | Windows Forms |
| **Frontend libraries** | `NBIISNET` (custom controls like `ListViewBase`), `CrystalDecisions` (for report viewing). |
| **JavaScript frameworks** | ‚ùå Not Applicable |

### 4.3. Data and storage
The application relies on a relational database and the local file system for storage.

#### 4.3.1. Database technologies
| Aspect | Technology/Framework |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Database management system(s)** | Microsoft SQL Server (inferred from server names like `SDC6001SQL28\S2K081` and `SQC6001SQL17\S2K082`). The copyright year 2008 suggests SQL Server 2008 or older. |
| **Database type** | Relational |
| **Data access technology** | ADO.NET with raw SQL queries and Stored Procedures. |
| **Database name(s)** | `BDSDCSDCIMA01`, `BDSQCSDCIMA01`, `BDSPCSDCIMA01` (for DVP, QLD, PRD environments respectively) |
| **Database connection string(s)** | Defined in `CIControlo.*.exe.config` files. Example: Server=`SDC6001SQL28\S2K081`;Database=`BDSDCSDCIMA01`. Authentication appears to be integrated (Windows Authentication). |
| **Database schema management** | Database-first approach. No evidence of code-first migrations. |
| **File/blob storage** | Local file system (e.g., `\\sqc6001fas02\imagens\DriveW\GCAA\Gestao\SharedLibrary\`) |

#### 4.3.2. Data flow
The data flow is a classic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pattern combined with a request-response model for the UI.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data sources** | - **Files**: `ENVM` and `ACOM` files from a monitored directory.<br>- **User Input**: From the Windows Forms UI.<br>- **Database**: Master data (users, balc√µes) and transactional data. |
| **Data sinks** | - **Database**: The primary sink for all processed data, statuses, and logs.<br>- **External Systems**: Data is sent to external systems via Web Services and potentially TIBCO. |
| **Data transformations** | Data is parsed from files, validated, and transformed into database entities. Business logic updates the state of these entities as they move through the workflow. |
| **Data flow patterns** | **Batch Processing**: File ingestion and remittance processing are handled in batches.<br>**Request-Response**: The UI interacts with the backend in a synchronous request-response manner. |
| **Data integrity** | Managed through database transactions (`BeginTrans`, `Commit`, `RollBack`). |

### 4.4. Web services and APIs
The application consumes at least one external web service.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **API type** | **SOAP**: The `MDIWebTransmCI.vbproj` project consumes a SOAP web service. |
| **API documentation** | **WSDL**: A `Insert_DocumentoMDIService.wsdl` file is referenced, defining the service contract. |
| **API endpoints** | `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService` |
| **Projects that provide APIs** | ‚ùå None. The application only consumes APIs. |

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
This section defines the metrics used in the code analysis table above.

| Metric | Description | Typical values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lines of Code** | Total number of lines of code, excluding comments and blank lines. | Lower is generally better. Projects over 10,000 LOC can become hard to manage. |
| **Cyclomatic complexity** | Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Higher values indicate more complex code that is harder to test and maintain. | A value below 10 is considered good; 10-20 is acceptable; above 20 is complex. |
| **Inheritance depth** | The maximum length of a path from a class to its root in the inheritance hierarchy. | Deep hierarchies ( > 4-5) can increase complexity and make code harder to understand. |
| **Classes coupling** | Measures the degree to which classes are dependent on each other. High coupling makes the system rigid and difficult to change. | Lower is better. A high number of dependencies per class indicates tight coupling. |
| **Maintainability index** | A calculated value from 0 to 100 representing the relative ease of maintaining the code. | > 85: Good. 65-85: Moderate. < 65: Difficult to maintain. |
| **Code deduplication** | The percentage of code that is duplicated across the codebase. High duplication increases maintenance effort. | < 5% is ideal. > 10% suggests a need for refactoring. |
| **Comments density (%)** | The percentage of lines that are comments. | 15-25% is often considered healthy. Very low values may indicate undocumented code. |

## 5. Dependencies
This section outlines the external and internal dependencies of the application.

### 5.1. External dependencies
The application relies on a few external, non-framework libraries, primarily for reporting and custom UI controls.

| Dependency | Description | Type | Assembly | Version | Runtime version | Source | License | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CrystalDecisions** | A reporting tool for creating and viewing reports. | Library | `CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.dll` | 13.0.2000.0 | v2.0.50727 | SAP | Proprietary | Generating reports in `CIReports.csproj`. |
| **GenericNet** | A proprietary/internal library for database access and configuration. | Library | `GenericNet.dll` | 2.0.0.1 | v2.0.50727 | Internal | Proprietary | Used across almost all projects for database operations. |
| **NBIISNET** | A proprietary/internal library providing custom UI controls like `ListViewBase`. | Library | `NBIISNET.dll` | 2.0.5.2 | v2.0.50727 | Internal | Proprietary | Used heavily in the Windows Forms projects. |

#### 5.1.1. Nuget packages
No `packages.config` or `<PackageReference>` items were found. Dependencies appear to be managed by direct DLL references from a shared network location, which is an outdated practice.

## 6. Security and compliance
This section provides an analysis of the application's security posture based on the provided code.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application employs basic, custom-built security mechanisms typical of its era.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Custom, based on the `User` class which is populated from the `VW_PASSWD_GROUP` database view. It relies on the user's Windows login name. |
| **Authorization** | Role-based, but implemented with a simple integer check (`m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup > 1`). There are no fine-grained permissions. |
| **ASP.NET Membership Provider** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: The application uses a custom user management system. |
| **Data protection** | üü† **Weak**: Passwords appear to be handled insecurely, as evidenced by the `if (m_sTIPACCP_NAME.Equals("passwd"))` check in `AccaoParam.cs`, which suggests passwords might be stored or transmitted in a reversible format. No evidence of modern data encryption at rest or in transit, beyond what the database or OS might provide. |
| **Audit logging** | A custom logging mechanism (`GenericLog`) is used, which records alerts and errors. It is not a comprehensive audit trail of all user actions. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
The application exhibits several high-risk vulnerabilities due to its age and coding practices.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | A01: Broken Access Control | Lack of granular authorization checks. | Authorization is based on a simple integer group ID check (`m_iUserGroup > 1`). This is coarse-grained and prone to error. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`, `UtilizadoresForm.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Implement claims-based or policy-based authorization. | [OWASP A01](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |
| SEC-002 | A02: Cryptographic Failures | Potential for insecure password handling. | The code in `AccaoParam.cs` that checks for a parameter named "passwd" suggests passwords may be stored or handled as configuration parameters, which is insecure. | `AccaoParam.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use a standard, secure identity management system like ASP.NET Core Identity with modern password hashing (e.g., Argon2). | [OWASP A02](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/) |
| SEC-003 | A03: Injection | **High risk of SQL Injection.** | The code extensively uses string concatenation to build SQL queries (e.g., `sQuery = "UPDATE ALERTA_ALERTA_ACCAO set ALACC_STATUS=1, ... where ALERT_ID=" + m_sALERT_ID`). This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, `DetalheRemessa.cs`, and likely many other data-access classes. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use parameterized queries or an ORM like Entity Framework Core exclusively. | [OWASP A03](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) |
| SEC-004 | A05: Security Misconfiguration | Unsafe configuration settings in `.config` files. | Database connection strings and server names are stored in plaintext `.config` files. The `useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true"` setting is also a sign of legacy configuration. | `CIControlo.*.exe.config`, `CIServico.*.exe.config` | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Use a secure secret management solution like Azure Key Vault. Remove legacy settings. | [OWASP A05](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) |
| SEC-005 | A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components | **Use of end-of-life .NET Framework 4.0.** | The entire application is built on .NET Framework 4.0, which is out of support and no longer receives security updates. This poses a significant risk. | All `.csproj` files. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Migrate the entire application to a supported .NET version (e.g., .NET 8). | [OWASP A06](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/) |

### 6.3. Advanced and .NET-specific security vulnerabilities
The application's reliance on older .NET technologies introduces framework-specific risks.

| Test case Id | Category / Domain | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-010 | Configuration | Hardcoded UNC paths to shared libraries. | The `.csproj` files reference DLLs from a hardcoded network share (`\\sqc6001fas02\imagens\DriveW\...`). This is insecure and makes dependency management difficult. | All `.csproj` files. | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Use a package manager like NuGet for all dependencies. | [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) |
| SEC-011 | Authorization | Custom authorization logic is brittle. | The `ConfirmaPrivilegios()` method relies on a simple integer comparison. This is not robust and hard to audit or extend. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Refactor to use a standard authorization framework. | [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/introduction) |
| SEC-012 | Data Access | Widespread use of raw SQL. | The application is built entirely on raw SQL queries, which is a major source of security (injection) and maintainability issues. | `Alerta.csproj`, `CIActividades.csproj`, etc. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Refactor to use an ORM like Entity Framework Core. | [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) |
| SEC-013 | Web.Config | Multiple environment-specific `.config` files. | The use of `CIControlo.DVP.exe.config`, `CIControlo.PRD.exe.config`, etc., indicates manual configuration management per environment, which is error-prone. | `CIControlo` and `CIServico` projects. | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Use a hierarchical configuration system (e.g., `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`). | [Config in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration) |

## 7. Integrations
The application integrates with several external systems and data sources.

| Integration type | Integration name | Integration description | Integration endpoint | Integration authentication | Integration data format | Integration protocols |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Service** | `waiaccesstuInsertDoc` | A web service for inserting MDI (Machine-Deposited Instrument) documents into another system. | `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService` | None specified (likely network-level) | SOAP/XML | HTTP |
| **File System** | `ENVM` and `ACOM` File Ingestion | The application monitors a directory for incoming `ENVM` and `ACOM` files, which contain remittance and transaction data. | Configurable file paths (e.g., `c:\tmp\`) | File system permissions | Fixed-width text | N/A |
| **Database** | GCAA Database | The application imports data directly from another database system named GCAA, likely for legacy data migration or integration. | `VPC6001SQL111\S2K081`, `BDSPGCCALX` | Windows Authentication | SQL | TDS |
| **Messaging (Inferred)** | TIBCO | A user interface element (`colTIBCOEstado`) suggests that the application interacts with a TIBCO messaging bus to check the status of transactions. | N/A (likely a message queue) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## 8. Testing
The application includes a dedicated project for automated testing.

| Testing type | Testing framework | Testing tools | Test coverage (%) | Test strategy | Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Deployment (CD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit Testing** | MSTest (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting`) | None identified (no mocking frameworks found) | üü¢ Low (Estimated < 10%) | The `CITestes` project contains a few tests, such as `Testa_ServRemessa_TratarTranchesBalcao`, which appear to be closer to integration tests as they involve database connections. | ‚ùå Not Implemented | ‚ùå Not Implemented |

## 13. Modernization strategy
This section outlines three potential modernization strategies for the application, addressing its technical debt and preparing it for the future.

### 13.1. Modernization strategy comparison
The following table compares the three strategies across several key factors.

| Strategy | Description | Complexity | Development time estimate | Functional testing time estimate | Infrastructure time estimate | Deployment time estimate | Total time estimate | Cost estimate | Risk | Long-term fit | Time-to-market | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)** | Upgrade the application to the latest .NET Framework (4.8.1) and update third-party libraries. Keep the existing on-premises deployment model. | üü† Medium | 3-5 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 8-14 weeks | üü† Medium | üü¢ Low | üî¥ Low | üü¢ Low | ‚úÖ Minimal code changes.<br>‚úÖ Low risk. | ‚ùå Does not address architectural flaws.<br>‚ùå Remains a monolith.<br>‚ùå Limited scalability. |
| **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)** | Rehost the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure VMs) and the database to a managed service (e.g., Azure SQL). Upgrade to .NET Framework 4.8.1. | üü† Medium | 3-5 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 10-17 weeks | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | ‚úÖ Gains cloud benefits (reliability, backups).<br>‚úÖ Minimal code changes. | ‚ùå Does not address architectural flaws.<br>‚ùå Not cloud-native.<br>‚ùå Higher operational cost. |
| **Complete Refactor** | Rewrite the application using modern technologies (.NET 8). Decompose the monolith into smaller, manageable services (e.g., API for processing, background service for jobs). | üî¥ High | 9-12 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 19-27 weeks | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üü¢ High | üî¥ High | ‚úÖ Resolves all technical debt.<br>‚úÖ Cloud-native and scalable.<br>‚úÖ High maintainability. | ‚ùå High cost and time investment.<br>‚ùå High risk of introducing new bugs.<br>‚ùå Requires significant testing effort. |

### 13.2. Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the recommended strategy is a **Complete Refactor**. While it carries the highest upfront cost and risk, it is the only strategy that addresses the fundamental architectural issues, security vulnerabilities (like SQL injection), and end-of-life technology stack. The long-term benefits in terms of maintainability, scalability, and security far outweigh the short-term advantages of a lift-and-shift approach.

#### 13.2.1. Step-by-step plan
The following is a high-level, step-by-step plan for the recommended **Complete Refactor** strategy.

| Phase | Step | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Discovery & Planning** | **1.1. Analyze & Decompose** | Identify bounded contexts (Remittances, Alerts, Users) and define the seams for decomposition into microservices. | Domain-Driven Design |
| | **1.2. Technology Selection** | Finalize the target technology stack: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, EF Core, a modern UI framework (if needed), and a cloud provider (e.g., Azure). | .NET 8, Azure |
| | **1.3. Database Migration Plan** | Plan the migration from the legacy SQL Server to Azure SQL Database, including schema updates and data migration. | Azure SQL, SSMS |
| **2. Core Refactoring** | **2.1. Data Access Layer** | Create a new data access layer using Entity Framework Core. Replace all raw SQL queries with LINQ or parameterized EF Core commands. | EF Core |
| | **2.2. Remittance Service** | Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project for the remittance processing logic. Encapsulate all business rules within this service. | ASP.NET Core |
| | **2.3. Alerting Service** | Create a separate background service (e.g., using Azure Functions or a Worker Service) to handle alert generation and processing. | Azure Functions |
| **3. UI & Integration** | **3.1. Rebuild UI** | Rebuild the control panel as a modern web application (e.g., Blazor or Angular) that consumes the new APIs. | Blazor/Angular |
| | **3.2. External Integrations** | Refactor file processing and web service consumption to use modern, resilient patterns (e.g., Polly for retries). | Polly, Azure Blob Storage |
| **4. Testing & Deployment** | **4.1. Comprehensive Testing** | Write extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the new services and UI. | xUnit, Moq |
| | **4.2. CI/CD Pipeline** | Set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to automate builds, testing, and deployments to Azure. | Azure DevOps |
| | **4.3. Go-Live** | Perform a phased rollout or a blue-green deployment to minimize downtime. Decommission the old on-premises infrastructure. | Azure App Service |

## 14. Application porfolio management
This section provides an analysis of the application's components and strategic fit, suitable for integration into an Application Portfolio Management (APM) tool like SAP LeanIX.

### 14.1. IT Component types and attributes
The following table maps the application's technologies to IT Component types.

| IT Component Type | Name | Version(s) | Provider(s) | Support start date | Support end date | Support end date (extended) | Support status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section evaluates the application's strategic value and recommends a course of action based on the TIME and 6R models.

| Classification | Evaluation & Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification** | **Tolerate/Migrate**: The application has high business value, as it manages a core financial process (remittance processing). However, its technical quality is extremely low due to its obsolete technology stack and architectural flaws. It should be tolerated in the short term while a migration/replacement project is executed. It is not a strategic asset in its current form. |
| **6R Classification** | **Refactor/Re-architect**: A simple "Retain" is not viable due to security risks. "Rehost" (lift-and-shift to the cloud) provides minimal value as it doesn't address the core technical debt. "Replace" with a COTS product could be an option, but given the custom logic, **Refactor** is the most appropriate strategy. This involves a complete rewrite on a modern, cloud-native platform to align it with future business needs. |

This application analysis was performed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI enhances the process, it may still produce inaccuracies, and all results should be carefully reviewed.
