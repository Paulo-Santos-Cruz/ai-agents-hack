## Markdown Formatting Rules (mandatory)
When writing Markdown documents, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure consistency and readability:
- Use **headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content hierarchically.
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for lists.
- Use **tables** where appropriate (e.g., for metrics, dependencies).
- Wrap any code examples in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Use **consistent indentation** and clear formatting throughout.
- Follow clean, simple structure as used in professional technical documentation.
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms or concepts.
- Use **italics** for emphasis on specific terms or concepts.
- Use **links** for references to external documentation or resources.
- Use **inline code** formatting for specific terms or commands (e.g., `Get-Process`).
- Use symbols for pros and cons, e.g., ✅ for pros and ❌ for cons.
- Use symbols for impact, e.g., 🔴 for high impact, 🟠 for medium impact, 🟢 for low impact, writing also the impact as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for risk, e.g., 🔴 for high risk, 🟠 for medium risk, 🟢 for low risk, writing also the risk as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for long-term fit, e.g., 🔴 for low long-term fit, 🟠 for medium long-term fit, 🟢 for high long-term fit, writing also the long-term fit as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for priority, e.g., 🔴 for high priority, 🟠 for medium priority, 🟢 for low priority, writing also the priority as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for severity, e.g., 🔴 for high severity, 🟠 for medium severity, 🟢 for low severity, writing also the severity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for complexity, e.g., 🔴 for high complexity, 🟠 for medium complexity, 🟢 for low complexity, writing also the complexity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for cost, e.g., 🔴 for high cost, 🟠 for medium cost, 🟢 for low cost, writing also the cost as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for support, e.g., ✅ for supported, ❌ for not supported, writing also the support status as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for used in the application, e.g., ✅ for used in the application, ❌ for not used in the application,❔ for likely, writing also the used in the application status as text after the symbol  

## Generic Mermaid Diagram Rules (mandatory)
When including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown document, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
- **Only the following Mermaid diagram types are allowed**: 'flowchart TD', 'sequenceDiagram','classDiagram','stateDiagram','erDiagram','gantt','journey','gitGraph','pie','mindmap','zenuml','quadrantChart','xychart-beta','block-beta','packet-beta','treemap-beta'.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x (Starts with "Figure X - " (for example, "Figure 1 - ")).
- The Mermaid diagram **must be placed exactly where it is referenced** in the document. Do not place it at the end or elsewhere
- If any node label contains **HTML tags** such as `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc., the **entire label must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`)**.
   - Correct example:
     `step1["Start <b>Process</b>"]`
   - Incorrect example:
     `step1[Start <b>Process</b>]`
     (This will break rendering and must be avoided.)
- Always **validate the Mermaid syntax** before including the diagram. The syntax must be correct to ensure the diagram renders properly in the final Markdown output. If validation is not possible, use only syntax known to be 100% correct.
- **Final checklist before including a Mermaid diagram:**
 - Validate Mermaid syntax to ensure no errors.
 - Enclose any HTML-containing node labels in double quotes.
 - Place the diagram exactly where referenced.
 - Immediately follow the diagram with a properly formatted caption starting with "Figure X -"
 - Make sure the caption is visually secondary and centered.
 - Use the following rules for all Mermaid diagram types (`flowchart`, `classDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, etc.) to ensure valid, portable, and compatible diagrams.

### General Unsupported Syntax (Do Not Use)

- Do not use special characters in identifiers or class names:
  - Avoid: \*, #, /, <>, {}, &, @, \$, \[]
  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores

- Do not use smart quotes:
  - Avoid: “ ”, ‘ ’
  - Use plain double or single quotes: "text", 'text'

- Do not use emojis or non-ASCII characters in any labels or class names

- Do not use HTML or Markdown formatting inside labels:
  - Avoid: <b>bold</b>, **bold**, fa\:icon, etc.

- Do not use empty curly braces:
  - Invalid: `class Foo {}` (if no members are defined)
  - Valid: `class Foo` for empty classes

- Do not leave special characters or spaces in labels without wrapping them in quotes:
  - Invalid: A\[User/Admin]
  - Valid: A\["User/Admin"]

- Do not reference undefined nodes or classes in relationships:
  - All identifiers used in edges (A --> B) must be declared

- Do not use multiple edge definitions on a single line:
  - Invalid: A --> B --> C
  - Valid: one edge per line

- Do not use nested or double curly braces like `{{`:
  - Only use `B{"Decision"}` where decision nodes are allowed

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: PascalCase or snake\_case

- Quote all labels containing:

  * Spaces: "Back Office"
  * Special characters: "Read/Write"
  * Dashes or dots: "Version 1.0"

- Format diagrams using fenced code blocks:

  ````
  ```mermaid
  diagramType
  ...
  ````

  ```
  ```

- Use `note` syntax correctly when supported:

  ```
  note for ClassName "Description here"
  ```

- Validate diagrams in your rendering context (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor)

### Diagram-Specific Rules

#### flowchart

- Use square brackets for nodes: A\["Label"]
- Use curly braces only for decisions: B{"Yes or No?"}
- Edges must use ONLY --> (arrow syntax) - never use --, <--, or --- in flowchart diagrams
- Do not use the class keyword

#### classDiagram

- Use `class ClassName {}` only when listing attributes or methods
- Do not use symbols like "\*" for class names
- For "everything" or "all" access, define a placeholder class such as AllEntities
- Use these for relationships:
  - Inheritance: Child <|-- Parent
  - Association: A ..> B : "Label"

#### sequenceDiagram

- Define all participants before referencing them
- Use only supported message arrows: ->>, -->> etc.
- Loops and conditions must follow valid syntax

### Summary

- Only use plain ASCII characters
- Avoid all special formatting, smart symbols, and undeclared references
- Always test your diagram using a Mermaid-compatible renderer

The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure, using table format. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

### 2.3. User roles and permissions
This section identifies hall distinct types of users (or autonomous systems) that interact with the application, using table format. These roles are inferred from authentication logic, authorization checks (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles="...")]` decorators, `if (user.hasPermission('...'))` blocks), or conditional logic based on user properties (e.g., 'user.is_admin', 'user.group').

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Role** (e.g., Administrator, Standard Operator, ReadOnly/Viewer, etc.)
- **Description** (e.g., Brief description of the role, e.g., "A role with elevated privileges, typically for managing the system itself rather than performing business operations.")

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities the role interacts with, e.g., "User, Role, Permission, SystemConfig
, AuditLog.")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the role, e.g., "Inferred from code blocks checking for a specific role name ('Admin'), a boolean flag ('isAdmin'), or a user ID of 0 or 1.")

Include a Mermaid 'classDiagram' diagram to visualize the relationships between the user roles, their permissions, and the key data entities they interact with.

### 2.4. Core business capabilities
This section lists the main, high-level capabilities of the application, representing its "Epics" or major functional domains, using table format

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities, e.g., "[InputData], [StagingRecord], [ImportLog].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the capability, e.g., "Assumes that any module listening for external input (file watchers, API endpoints) is part of this capability. Inferred from service layers or classes with names like `Processor`, `Engine`, `Calculator`, or `Orchestrator`.") 

Include a Mermaid applicable diagram to visualize the core business capabilities and their relationships.

### 2.5. Detailed feature breakdown
This critical section provides a granular breakdown of individual features within each Core Business Capability, using table format. Each feature is described in terms of its user story, key data entities involved, and any inferred logic or flowcharts that illustrate the internal workings.

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Feature** (e.g., Execute [Process Name], Generate [Report Name], etc.)

##Critical instructions for these sections (Functional overview section an subsections):
- Rule 1: Source Code is the Only Truth. Your analysis **MUST** be based exclusively and entirely on a deep-dive analysis of provided source code. Do **NOT** invent features or use external knowledge about common business practices unless it is a direct and logical inference from a code artifact. Every piece of functionality you document must be traceable to a class, method, UI element, database query, or data model found in the code.
- Rule 2: Explicitly State All Assumptions. When the code's intent is ambiguous (e.g., a poorly named variable or function), you **MUST** make a logical inference and clearly label it as an "Assumption."
 - Example:** In the 'Assumptions' column, write: *"Assuming the boolean flag `is_mgr` in the `User` class denotes a 'Manager' role with supervisory capabilities."
-Rule 3: Functional "What," Not Technical "How."* You must relentlessly translate technical implementation details into business-centric functional descriptions. Your audience is business stakeholders and new developers who need to understand purpose, not implementation.
- **BAD (Technical):** "The `btnSubmit_Click` event handler calls the `SaveOrderToDB` method, which executes an `INSERT` SQL statement."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The 'Submit New Order' feature allows a user to persist the order details into the system's database."
 - **BAD (Technical):** "The system uses a `List<Customer>` object to hold the data."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The system manages a collection of 'Customer' data entities."
- Rule 4: Strict Adherence to the Template. You **MUST** follow the provided Markdown template precisely, section by section. Populate all tables as requested. Generate the specified Mermaid diagrams for each section where they apply, ensuring the syntax is correct and enclosed in proper Markdown code fences (e.g., ` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
- Rule 5: Be Universal and Reusable. Your final output should use generic placeholders (e.g., `[PrimaryBusinessObject]`, `[User Role]`, `[Process Name]`) as instructed in the template. This ensures the document you generate serves as a perfect, reusable template for analyzing any application in the future.
- Do not begin generating the response until you have fully understood these five critical rules.

##Instructions for this section:
 - Given the detailed analysis of this .NET application, provide three complete modernization strategies in a table format, and the step-by-step plan, also in a table format, to implement them.
 - Strategy 1: **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)**, maintaining the application current deployment model (e.g. on-premises) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 2: **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**, rehosting the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 3: **Refactor** (also known as "Repackage"), refactoring the application to use modern design patterns, architectures and technologies, e.g., microservices, serverless, cloud-native, etc, evolving the application to the latest .NET version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc.
 - Provide a table with comparison between the three strategies, including the pros and cons of each one with the following columns:
  - **Factor** (e.g., Complexity, Cost (Development), Cost (Functional testing), Cost (Infrastructure), Time to implement (Development), Time to test (Functional testing), Time to implement (Infrastructure), Risk, Long-term fit, time-to-market, etc.)
  - **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)
  - **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting)
  - **Complete Refactor** (Refactor)

- The complexity and the time estimate to implement each strategy depends on the following factors which are only related with the development effort and not with the infrastructure or deployment effort:
 - Complexity low - the application is small, with few dependencies and a simple architecture = 1-2 weeks
 - Complexity medium - the application is medium-sized, with some dependencies and a moderate architecture = 3-5 weeks
 - Complexity high - the application is large, with many dependencies and a complex architecture = 6-8 weeks
 - Complexity very high - the application is very large, with many dependencies and a very complex architecture = 9-12 weeks

 ##Instruction: You must separate the development effort from the infrastructure or deployment effort, so the complexity and time estimate must be only related with the development effort.

- The Mermaid diagram MUST be placed in the section where it is referenced, not at the end of the document.
- **Syntax Rule:** When defining a node's text label, if the text contains any HTML tags (like `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`), you MUST enclose the entire text label in double quotes (`"`). Example: `id["Text with <b>HTML</b>"]` is correct; `id[Text with <b>HTML</b>]` is incorrect and will fail.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x.
- ALWAYS VALIDATE / ENSURE THE DIAGRAM SYNTAX BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT, TO ENSURE IT IS CORRECT AND WILL RENDER PROPERLY IN THE FINAL MARKDOWN OUTPUT.

#Critical instructions for the caption (always apply):
- Immediately following the ` ```mermaid ` code block, you MUST place a text **caption**.
- The caption must start with "Figure X." (e.g., "Figure 1:"), followed by a brief description of the diagram.
- The caption should be in a smaller font or otherwise styled to be secondary to the main text.

## 2. Functional overview
This section provides a high-level functional decomposition of the application, identifying the major functional blocks as inferred from the code's structure.

### 2.1. Executive summary
Based on the analysis of entry points, class names, and core processes, the application's primary function is to serve as an internal banking tool for the **management and processing of financial remittances**. It provides a desktop interface for operators to monitor the status of these remittances, handle errors, and manage associated documents. A background Windows service automates the processing pipeline, from file ingestion to database updates, while an alerting system notifies users of key events or failures.

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
The application is functionally divided into several key modules, each responsible for a distinct part of the business process.

| Functional Area / Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Interaction & Presentation** | Manages the graphical user interface for operators. This includes forms for monitoring remittance statuses (`ActividadesForm`), viewing document details (`MostraImagem`), managing system configurations (`CIConfigForm`), and handling alerts (`AlertasForm`). It is the primary interface between the user and the system's core logic. |
| **Remittance Processing Engine** | This is the core logic engine of the application. It's responsible for fetching remittances that need processing, breaking them down into tranches, validating documents, and updating their status in the database. This logic is executed by the background service. |
| **File Ingestion & Parsing** | Handles the intake of external data files, specifically `ACOM` and `ENVM` files. This module reads and parses these files, validates their structure (header, detail, trailer), and inserts the data into the appropriate database tables for further processing. |
| **Alerting & Notification** | A dedicated module for generating and dispatching alerts based on predefined system events and situations. It supports multiple notification channels, including email, SMS, and logging to various sinks like the database, a file, or the Windows Event Viewer. |
| **Data Persistence & Management**| This area covers all interactions with the database. It includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting records related to remittances, documents, users, and configuration settings. Data access is performed primarily through direct ADO.NET SQL queries. |
| **Reporting & Analytics** | Responsible for generating business reports using Crystal Reports. This module provides insights into remittance volumes, processing summaries, and monthly billing data. |

### 2.3. User roles and permissions
The application logic suggests at least two distinct user roles with different levels of privilege.

| Role | Description | Permissions | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | A privileged role with full system access, likely responsible for configuration and maintenance. | - Full CRUD on all data entities.<br>- Ability to change the state of any remittance or document.<br>- Access to system configuration and user management. | `ChangeEstado`, `ReenviarTodasRemessasEmErro`, `UtilizadorConfig`, `CIConfiguracao` | `User`, `Passwd_Group`, `Activity_Change`, `Balcao` | Inferred from `if (m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup <= 1)` checks, suggesting that groups 0 and 1 have elevated permissions. |
| **Standard Operator** | A standard user responsible for day-to-day monitoring and operational tasks. | - Read-only access to most data.<br>- Limited ability to perform actions on remittances (e.g., viewing details, refreshing lists).<br>- No access to system-level configuration. | `Refresh`, `ViewDetails`, `ViewImage` | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred as the default role for users with `m_iUserGroup > 1`, who are restricted from performing state-changing actions. |

### 2.5. Detailed feature breakdown
This section provides a granular breakdown of individual features within each Core Business Capability.

| Feature | User Story / Description | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monitor Remittance Activity** | As a Standard Operator, I can view a dashboard of all remittances, filterable by date and status, so that I can track the overall health of the system. | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | Inferred from `ActividadesForm.cs` and its various list views and filter controls. |
| **Resubmit Failed Remittance**| As an Administrator, I can select a remittance in an "Error" state and manually trigger a re-processing job, so that I can resolve transient issues without manual data re-entry. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `btnRemessasErro_Click` event handler in `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`, which calls a stored procedure `Update_ReenviarTodasRemessasBalcaoEmErro`. |
| **View Document Image** | As a Standard Operator, I can select a specific document within a remittance and view its scanned image to verify its contents. | `Documento`, `Imagem` | Inferred from the `MostraImagem.cs` form and the `toolStripMenuDocumentosVerImagem` menu item. |
| **Configure Alert Action** | As an Administrator, I can associate a specific system situation (e.g., "Remittance Processing Failed") with a notification action (e.g., "Send Email to Ops Team") to ensure timely intervention. | `SituacaoAccao`, `Accao`, `AccaoParam` | Inferred from the `CIConfigForm.cs` UI, which allows for managing associations between situations and actions. |

### 2.6. Key data entities and their attributes
The application's logic revolves around a few core data entities.

| Entity | Description | Key Attributes | Data Type | Validation Rules | Relationships | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remessa** | Represents a batch of documents submitted for processing, typically from a bank branch (`Balcao`). | `REMIN_ID`, `REMIN_DATA`, `REMINSTAT_ID`, `REMIN_BALCAO`, `REMIN_NUMERO` | `long`, `DateTime`, `int`, `int`, `int` | `REMIN_ID` is the primary key. `REMINSTAT_ID` must be a valid status. | Has a one-to-many relationship with `Tranche` and `Documento`. | Inferred from classes like `DetalheRemessa.cs` and view names like `VW_REMESSA_BALCAO_DETALHE`. |

### 2.7. Business process workflows
This section describes and visualizes critical end-to-end processes.

| Process | Description | Key Steps | User Roles Involved | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Workflow** | A comprehensive workflow that outlines the steps involved in processing a remittance from ingestion to final output. | 1. Remittance is identified for processing.<br>2. Status is set to "In Progress".<br>3. Documents are grouped into tranches.<br>4. Each tranche is processed.<br>5. Remittance status is updated to "Completed" or "Error". | System (Automated) | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the logic in `ServRemessa.cs` and `ProcessarTrancheBalcao.cs`. The process is automated by the `CIServico` Windows Service. |
| **Alerting Workflow** | The process of detecting a system situation and executing a predefined notification action. | 1. A system event triggers a situation (e.g., error in processing).<br>2. An alert record is created.<br>3. The alerting service (`ServAlerta`) picks up the alert.<br>4. The associated action (e.g., send email) is executed.<br>5. The alert is marked as processed. | System (Automated), Administrator (configures rules) | `AlertaSituacaoAccao`, `SituacaoAccao`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `Alerta` project and the `ServAlerta.cs` class, which orchestrates the alert processing logic. |
| **Manual Error Intervention** | A user-driven workflow to manually handle and resubmit failed remittances or estornos (reversals). | 1. Operator filters for items in an "Error" state.<br>2. Operator selects one or more failed items.<br>3. Operator clicks the "Re-submit" button.<br>4. The system flags the items for re-processing by the background service. | Administrator, Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Estorno` | Inferred from UI elements like `btnRemessasErro_Click` and `btnEstonoErro_Click` in `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`. |

#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Remittance Processing Workflow
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Remittance Processing Workflow, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identify Remittance** | The background service queries the database to find a remittance with a "Pending" status. | System | `Remessa` | Inferred from `ServRemessa.RemessaBalcaoParaProcessar()`, which selects a remittance to be processed. |
| **2. Begin Processing** | The system updates the remittance's status to "In Progress" to prevent other threads from processing it. | System | `Remessa` | Assumes a state transition from "Pending" (e.g., status 20) to "In Progress" (e.g., status 30) as seen in `ProcessaRemessa`. |
| **3. Create Tranches** | Documents within the remittance are grouped into smaller batches (tranches) for processing. A new `Tranche` record is created. | System | `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the loop in `ProcessaRemessa` that calls `CriarTranche` based on `m_oParameters.m_iMaxDocsTranche`. |
| **4. Process Documents** | Each document in the tranche is validated, and its data is processed. The document's status is updated. | System | `Documento` | Inferred from the `ProcessaDocumento` method, which performs validation and updates the document state. |
| **5. Finalize Tranche** | Once all documents in a tranche are processed, the tranche status is updated to "Completed". | System | `Tranche` | Assumes a state transition to a completed status (e.g., status 20) after the loop. |
| **6. Finalize Remittance** | After all tranches are completed, the remittance status is updated to "Completed" (or "Error" if any step failed). | System | `Remessa` | The final step in `ProcessaRemessa` is to update the remittance status to a final state (e.g., 40 for success, -40 for error). |

#### 2.7.2. Workflow: Alerting Workflow
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Alerting Workflow, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Trigger Alert** | A business process (e.g., remittance processing) encounters a specific condition (e.g., an error) and calls a stored procedure to create an alert. | System | `AlertaSituacaoAccao` | Inferred from `m_oParameters.EnviarAlertaSituacao()`, which is called from various parts of the application to log alerts. |
| **2. Fetch Pending Alert** | The background alerting service queries the database for alerts with a "Pending" status (e.g., `ALACC_STATUS=0`). | System | `AlertaSituacaoAccao` | Inferred from `ServAlerta.AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar()`. |
| **3. Determine Action Type** | The service inspects the alert to determine the type of action to perform (e.g., Email, SMS, Log). | System | `Accao` | Based on the `switch` statement on `oAlSitAcc.m_oSituacaoAccao.m_oAccao.m_enuTIPACC_ID` in `ServAlerta.cs`. |
| **4. Execute Action** | The corresponding action handler is invoked. For an email, it constructs and sends the message. For a log, it writes to the configured target. | System | `AccaoParam` | Inferred from methods like `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccaoMail` and `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccaoLogFile`. |
| **5. Mark as Processed** | The alert's status is updated to "Processed" in the database to prevent it from being handled again. | System | `AlertaSituacaoAccao` | Inferred from the call to `oAlSitAcc.SetProcessado(m_oParameters)`. |

#### 2.7.3. Workflow: Manual Error Intervention
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Manual Error Intervention workflow, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Open Activity Form** | The user opens the `ActividadeBalcaoForm` to view the status of remittances and reversals. | Administrator, Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Estorno` | This is the main entry point for this user task. |
| **2. Filter for Errors** | The user applies filters (e.g., clicks the "Error" status button) to display only failed items. | Administrator, Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Estorno` | Inferred from the `toolStripButtonErro` UI element and the filtering logic in `filtrosRemessas`. |
| **3. Select Items** | The user selects one or more failed remittances or reversals from the list view. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Estorno` | Standard user interaction with a `ListView` control. |
| **4. Trigger Resubmission** | The user clicks the "Re-submit items in error" button. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Estorno` | Inferred from the `btnRemessasErro_Click` and `btnEstonoErro_Click` event handlers. |
| **5. System Flags for Reprocessing** | An `UPDATE` statement or stored procedure call (`Update_ReenviarTodasRemessasBalcaoEmErro`) is executed to change the status of the selected items, making them eligible for reprocessing by the background service. | System | `Remessa`, `Estorno` | The event handlers call a stored procedure to perform the backend update. |

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
The application includes a background service that runs automated jobs.

| Process Name | Trigger / Schedule | Purpose | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Job**| Runs continuously in a timed loop within the `CIServico` Windows Service. | To automate the processing of new and pending remittances without manual intervention. | - `Select_Remessa2Process` to find work.<br>- `Update_ProcessaRemessaProc` to process.<br>- `Update_EstadoRemessa` to finalize. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `CIServicoThread` class, which contains a main processing loop (`while (!m_bStop)`). |
| **File Ingestion Job** | Runs periodically (every `m_iTempoEntreIteracoesFicheiros` minutes) to check for new files. | To automatically import data from external systems via `ENVM` and `ACOM` files. | - Scans configured directories (`m_sFilePathENVM`, `m_sFilePathACOM`).<br>- Parses files line by line.<br>- Inserts data into staging tables. | `Ficheiro`, `Lote`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `CheckForFileENVM2Import` and `CheckForFileACOM2Import` methods in `CIServicoThread.cs`. |
| **Alerting Service Job** | Runs continuously in a timed loop within the `CIServico` Windows Service. | To process pending alerts and send out notifications. | - `AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar` to find alerts.<br>- `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccao` to execute the action (e.g., send email). | `AlertaSituacaoAccao`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `CheckForAlertas2Process` method in `CIServicoThread.cs`. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section describes the architectural patterns and design principles observed in the source code.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a traditional N-Tier monolithic architecture.

| Pattern Type | Patterns Observed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High-Level Architecture** | **N-Tier Monolithic**: The application is structured into distinct projects representing presentation (UI), business logic, and data access concerns, but they are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit (or a main executable with supporting libraries). |
| **Architectural Patterns (UI)** | **Model-View-Presenter (MVP) / Supervising Controller**: The Windows Forms classes (`*Form.cs`) act as Views, containing UI elements and event handlers. They instantiate and delegate to controller-like or business logic classes (`ServRemessa`, `Actividades`) which interact with the data and update the view. |
| **Creational Patterns** | ❔ **Factory Method (Likely)**: Inferred from the separation of concerns, it is likely that simple factory methods are used to instantiate business objects, although no explicit factory classes were found in the provided snippets. |
| **Structural Patterns** | ❌ **None explicitly identified**: The code does not show evidence of common structural patterns like Adapter, Decorator, or Proxy. |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | ❔ **Command (Likely)**: The menu items and buttons in the UI that trigger specific business operations (e.g., `btnRemessasErro_Click`) can be considered an implementation of the Command pattern, where a UI event is mapped to a specific action. |
| **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** | ❌ **Repository, Unit of Work**: Not observed. Data access is performed via direct SQL queries within business or UI-related classes, rather than being abstracted behind a repository. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application is built using a layered architectural style.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | The architecture is separated into logical layers, primarily: <br> - **Presentation Layer**: `CIControlo`, `CIActividades` (Windows Forms).<br> - **Business Logic Layer**: `CIServRemessas`, `CIServAlertas`, `CIFicheiro`.<br> - **Data Access Layer**: Implicitly defined through direct `System.Data.SqlClient` usage within business logic classes.<br> - **Shared Components**: `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. |
| **Dependency Flow** | The dependency flow is generally top-down: UI depends on Business Logic, which in turn depends on Shared Components and performs data access. There are no strict dependency rules enforced, leading to some coupling (e.g., UI forms directly instantiating `SqlDataReader`). |
| **Bounded Contexts** | ❌ Not applicable. As a monolithic application, there is no clear separation into distinct bounded contexts. All modules operate on a shared database schema. |
| **Communication** | - **Synchronous**: UI interactions and direct method calls.<br>- **Asynchronous**: The background service (`CIServico`) operates asynchronously from the UI.<br>- **Web Service**: SOAP communication with an external service. |
| **Dependency Injection** | ❌ **None**: Dependencies are created manually using the `new` keyword (e.g., `CIServRemessas.ServRemessa servRemessa = new CIServRemessas.ServRemessa(this, m_oParameters);`). There is no Inversion of Control (IoC) container. |

### 3.3. Key design patterns and principles applied
The codebase reflects design principles common in applications from its era.

| Principle | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID Principles** | 🟠 **Partial Adherence**: <br>- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Partially followed through the use of multiple projects (`Alerta`, `CIServRemessas`), each handling a specific concern. However, classes often have multiple responsibilities (e.g., UI forms containing data access logic).<br>- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Not strongly evident. Adding new alert types requires modifying the `switch` statement in `ServAlerta.cs`.<br>- **Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion**: Not explicitly observed. The lack of dependency injection and heavy use of concrete classes indicates these principles were not a primary focus. |
| **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** | 🟠 **Moderate Adherence**: Some code appears to be repeated, such as the UI logic for creating and managing `ListView` controls across different forms. However, the use of shared libraries like `CIConfigGlobalParameters` helps centralize common functionality. |
| **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**| ✅ **Generally Followed**: The logic within individual methods is straightforward and easy to understand. The overall design avoids overly complex abstractions. |
| **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**| ✅ **Generally Followed**: The application appears focused on its specific business purpose without unnecessary features. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | 🟠 **Partial Adherence**: There is a clear separation at the project level (UI, Service, Logic). However, within projects, concerns are often mixed. For instance, UI forms (`ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`) contain direct database query construction and execution logic, mixing presentation with data access. |
| **Clean Code Principles** | 🟠 **Mixed**: Naming conventions are generally followed, but some classes and methods could be more descriptive. The presence of empty `catch` blocks (`catch{}`) is a significant code smell. |
| **Testability** | 🟠 **Limited**: The `CITestes` project indicates that testing was considered. However, the tight coupling and lack of dependency injection make unit testing difficult. Tests are more likely to be integration tests that require a database connection. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
The application does not follow a formal Domain-Driven Design approach.

| DDD Concept | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | ❌ **Limited/None**: While there are classes that represent domain concepts (e.g., `Remessa`, `Documento`), they are primarily data containers (Anemic Domain Model) rather than rich domain objects with behavior. Core DDD patterns like Aggregates, Value Objects, and Domain Events are not used. |
| **Ubiquitous Language** | 🟠 **Partially Evident**: The class and method names (`Remessa`, `Tranche`, `TratarTranchesBalcao`) use terms from the business domain (banking, remittances), suggesting a shared language between developers and business experts. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | ❌ **Not Followed**: The architecture is a classic N-Tier, not a DDD-style layered architecture with distinct Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. Business logic is mixed with data access and sometimes presentation logic. |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application uses several common data access and interaction patterns.

| Pattern | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CQRS** | ❌ **Not Used**: There is no separation between commands (writes) and queries (reads). The same classes and methods handle both operations. |
| **Event Sourcing** | ❌ **Not Used**: The application state is stored directly in the database, not as a sequence of events. |
| **Repository Pattern** | ❌ **Not Used**: Data access is performed directly using `SqlDataReader` and raw SQL strings, often within business logic or UI classes. There is no abstraction layer for data persistence. |
| **Unit of Work Pattern**| ❌ **Not Used**: Transactions are managed manually using `m_oParameters.BeginTrans()` and `Commit()`/`RollBack()`, but this is not encapsulated in a formal Unit of Work pattern. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
Cross-cutting concerns are handled through shared libraries and direct implementation.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | A custom `GenericLog` class is used for logging alerts and errors. `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine` is also used for debug output. |
| **Exception Handling**| Standard `try-catch` blocks are used. Some `catch` blocks are empty, which can hide errors. |
| **Configuration Management**| Handled via `.config` files (`app.config`, `CIControlo.exe.config`) and `Properties.Settings`. A custom `CIGlobalParameters` class centralizes access to these settings. |
| **Authentication** | Based on the logged-in Windows user (`System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`). |
| **Authorization** | Simple role-based checks using `m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup`. |
| **Dependency Injection** | ❌ Not used. Dependencies are instantiated directly. |

### 3.7. Deployment
The application is designed for on-premises deployment.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs Microservices** | **Monolithic**: The application is a single, tightly-coupled system, deployed as a set of executables and libraries. |
| **Scalability Design** | 🟠 **Limited**: Scalability is limited to vertical scaling (increasing resources of the host server). There is no built-in design for horizontal scaling. The background service could potentially be run on multiple servers if the database queuing mechanism (`Select_Remessa2Process`) is designed to be atomic. |
| **Cloud-Native Design** | ❌ **Not Cloud-Native**: The application relies on local file system paths (e.g., `c:\tmp\`), UNC paths (`\\sqc6001fas02`), and direct database connections, making it unsuitable for a cloud-native environment without significant changes. |
| **Containerization** | ❌ **Not Containerized**: No `Dockerfile` or container configurations were found. |
| **Deployment Target Platform** | **AnyCPU**: The projects are configured to run on any CPU architecture (x86 or x64) where the .NET Framework is installed. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application has specific infrastructure dependencies.

| Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | **Microsoft SQL Server**: The application is tightly coupled to SQL Server, using `System.Data.SqlClient` and stored procedures. Server names like `SDC6001SQL28\S2K081` suggest specific instances are required. |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | ❌ **None**: No message brokers or event buses are used. The database is used as a queue for work items (e.g., pending remittances). |
| **External Integrations**| - **File System**: Relies on network shares or local directories for file-based data exchange (`ACOM`, `ENVM` files).<br>- **SOAP Web Service**: Integrates with an external service at `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService`. |

### 3.9. Documentation artifacts
The solution contains some artifacts that serve as documentation.

| Artifact | Analysis |

#### 5.1.1. Nuget packages
No `packages.config` or `<PackageReference>` elements were found in the project files. It is concluded that the application does not use NuGet for package management, relying instead on direct assembly references from a shared network drive.

## 6. Security and compliance
This section outlines the security posture of the application based on code analysis.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application implements basic security mechanisms common for internal enterprise applications of its era.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Implicitly uses the logged-in Windows user's identity (`System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`). No explicit login form is present in the main control application. |
| **Authorization** | A simple role-based system is implemented via a `GROUP_ID` associated with the user. Code checks like `if (m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup > 1)` restrict access to sensitive functionality. |
| **ASP.NET Membership Provider** | ❌ Not used. The application is primarily a desktop/service application and manages users in its own database tables. |
| **Data protection** | 🟠 **Limited**: The code shows an attempt to mask passwords in a `ListView` (`sTipaccp_codificado = "********"`) but there is no evidence of encryption at rest for sensitive data in the database or in configuration files. |
| **Audit logging** | A custom logging mechanism (`GenericLog`) is used, which can log alerts and errors to the database, providing a basic audit trail of system events. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
The application exhibits several vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10 (2021).

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | A01: Broken Access Control | Insufficient authorization checks. | Privileged actions are controlled by a simple integer check (`m_iUserGroup > 1`), which could be brittle. A more robust, claims-based or permission-based model is recommended. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`, `MudarEstadoForm.cs` | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Implement fine-grained, policy-based authorization. | [OWASP A01](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |
| SEC-002 | A03: Injection | **High Risk of SQL Injection**. | Raw SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation with user-provided or database-sourced IDs (e.g., `sQuery += " where ALERT_ID=" + m_sALERT_ID`). | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs` | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Use parameterized queries or an ORM for all database access. | [OWASP A03](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) |
| SEC-003 | A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components | Use of End-of-Life .NET Framework. | The application targets .NET Framework 4.0, which is no longer supported and does not receive security updates. | All `.csproj` files | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Migrate the application to a supported .NET version (e.g., .NET 8). | [OWASP A06](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/) |
| SEC-004 | A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | Incomplete or inconsistent logging. | Exception handling often involves empty `catch` blocks or logging generic messages, which can obscure the root cause of security events or failures. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, `ServAlerta.cs` | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Implement centralized, structured logging for all exceptions and security-relevant events. | [OWASP A09](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/) |

### 6.3. Advanced and .NET-specific security vulnerabilities
The analysis revealed several .NET-specific security weaknesses.

| Test case Id | Category / Domain | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-010 | Configuration | Hardcoded UNC paths to shared libraries. | The `.csproj` files contain hardcoded paths to a network share (`\\sqc6001fas02\...\`). This is a security and maintenance risk. | `*.csproj` files | 🟢 Low | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Use NuGet packages or a local dependency store. | - |
| SEC-011 | Exception Handling | Empty catch blocks. | Several methods, such as `AccaoParam(SqlDataReader dr)`, contain empty `catch {}` blocks, which silently swallow exceptions. | `AccaoParam.cs`, `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs` | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | Log all exceptions and handle them appropriately. | [CWE-390](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/390.html) |
| SEC-012 | Data Access | Mixing data access logic with UI code. | Forms like `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs` directly build and execute SQL queries, violating separation of concerns and increasing the risk of vulnerabilities. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs`, `AlertasForm.cs` | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🔴 High | Refactor data access into a dedicated repository or data access layer. | - |

### 6.4. Security hardening opportunities
Several opportunities for security hardening were identified.

| Area | Current state | Hardening opportunity | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |

| **File System** | **ACOM/ENVM File Share**| A network directory where `ACOM` and `ENVM` files are dropped for processing by the background service. | `c:\tmp\` (from config, likely a network share in production) | N/A | Fixed-width text | SMB |
| **Shared Library**| **GCAA Shared DLLs** | A network share hosting common internal libraries used across multiple applications. | `\\sqc6001fas02\imagens\DriveW\GCAA\Gestao\SharedLibrary\` | N/A | .dll | SMB |
| **Web Service** | **Insert Document Service**| An external SOAP web service for inserting MDI documents. | `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService` | None (HTTP) | XML/SOAP | HTTP |

## 8. Testing
The solution includes a dedicated project for testing, indicating an established testing practice.

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Testing type** | **Unit/Integration Testing**: The `CITestes` project contains test classes that appear to perform both unit tests (instantiating classes) and integration tests (requiring database connections). |
| **Testing framework** | **MSTest**: The project references `Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework.dll`. |
| **Testing tools** | None identified besides the core framework. No mocking libraries like Moq are referenced. |
| **Test coverage (%)** | **Unknown**: No code coverage data is available. The number of test methods is small compared to the number of projects, suggesting coverage is likely low. |
| **Test strategy** | The tests seem to follow a feature-based approach, with test classes like `CIServRemessaTestes` targeting specific business logic components. |

## 13. Modernization strategy
This section provides a comparison of potential modernization strategies for the application.

### 13.1. Modernization strategy comparison
Given the application's age, technical debt, and use of unsupported technologies, several modernization paths are possible.

| Strategy | Description | Complexity | Development time estimate | Functional testing time estimate | Infrastructure time estimate | Deployment time estimate | Total time estimate | Cost estimate | Risk | Long-term fit | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)| Upgrade the application to .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to a supported SQL Server version. Keep the existing on-premises deployment model and monolithic architecture. | 🟠 Medium | 3-5 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 1 week | 7-11 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟢 Low | 🔴 Low | ✅ **Fastest time-to-market**<br>✅ **Lowest immediate cost**<br>✅ **Removes immediate EOL risks** | ❌ **Does not address architectural flaws**<br>❌ **Limited scalability and maintainability gains**<br>❌ **Still a legacy monolith** |
| **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting) | Rehost the application to Azure VMs and the database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. Upgrade to .NET Framework 4.8.1. | 🟠 Medium | 4-6 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 10-16 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | ✅ **Cloud benefits (reliability, managed infra)**<br>✅ **Removes EOL risks**<br>✅ **Step towards modernization** | ❌ **Still a monolith**<br>❌ **Does not leverage cloud-native features**<br>❌ **Higher operational cost than on-prem** |
| **Complete Refactor** | Re-architect the application to be cloud-native. Rewrite the UI as a web application (Blazor/ASP.NET Core), the service as Azure Functions or a Worker Service, and migrate to .NET 8. | 🔴 High | 9-12 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 21-29 weeks | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🟢 High | ✅ **Highest long-term value**<br>✅ **Modern, scalable, and maintainable**<br>✅ **Leverages cloud-native services**<br>✅ **Resolves all technical debt** | ❌ **Highest cost and risk**<br>❌ **Longest time-to-market**<br>❌ **Requires significant developer upskilling** |

### 13.2. Recommendation
The recommended strategy is a **phased approach leading to a Complete Refactor**.

1.  **Phase 1: Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**: The immediate priority is to mitigate the security risks associated with the end-of-life .NET Framework and SQL Server. Rehosting to Azure provides immediate infrastructure benefits and stability. This phase is relatively low-risk and delivers quick value by moving to a supported, managed environment.
2.  **Phase 2: Strangle and Refactor**: After stabilizing the application in the cloud, begin a gradual refactoring process. Identify bounded contexts (e.g., Alerting, Reporting) and extract them as separate microservices or serverless functions. Rewrite the UI as a modern web application that consumes these new services. This "Strangler Fig" approach allows for incremental modernization, reducing the risk of a "big bang" rewrite.

This two-phased strategy balances the immediate need for security and supportability with the long-term goal of a modern, maintainable, and scalable application.

#### 13.2.1. Step-by-step plan
This plan outlines the steps for the recommended phased modernization strategy.

| Phase | Step | Task | Description | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Lift & Shift** | 1 | **Analysis & Planning** | Use the Azure Migrate tool to analyze dependencies and plan the migration. | Azure Migrate |
| | 2 | **Infrastructure Setup** | Provision Azure VMs for the application/service and an Azure SQL Managed Instance for the database. | Azure VMs, Azure SQL MI |
| | 3 | **Framework Upgrade** | Upgrade all projects to .NET Framework 4.8.1. Update all third-party libraries to the latest compatible versions. | Visual Studio, .NET 4.8.1 |
| | 4 | **Database Migration** | Use Azure Data Migration Service to migrate the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. | Azure DMS |
| | 5 | **Configuration Update** | Update all connection strings and configuration settings to point to the new Azure resources. Externalize secrets to Azure Key Vault. | app.config, Azure Key Vault |
| | 6 | **Deploy & Test** | Deploy the updated application to the Azure VMs. Conduct full regression and performance testing. | Azure DevOps, MSTest |
| **Phase 2: Refactor** | 7 | **Identify First Service** | Identify a loosely coupled component to extract first (e.g., the Alerting module). | - |
| | 8 | **Rewrite as Microservice**| Rewrite the Alerting logic as a .NET 8 Azure Function or a containerized Worker Service. | .NET 8, Azure Functions |
| | 9 | **Rewrite UI** | Begin rewriting the UI as a Blazor Server or WebAssembly application, consuming the new microservice via a REST API. | Blazor, ASP.NET Core Web API |
| | 10 | **Iterate** | Repeat steps 7-9 for other modules (Reporting, File Ingestion, etc.), gradually strangling the old monolith until it can be fully retired. | - |

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section evaluates the application's strategic value and recommends a portfolio strategy.

| Classification | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification**| **Migrate**: The application provides high business value as it manages a core banking process (remittances). However, its technical quality is very low due to obsolete technology, security risks, and high maintenance costs. It is not a candidate for elimination but requires significant investment to be moved to a modern platform. The goal is to migrate its functionality to a new, sustainable architecture. |
| **6R Classification** | **Re-architect / Refactor**: The application is a prime candidate for the **Re-architect** (or Refactor) strategy. A simple Rehost would not address the underlying architectural issues and technical debt. A full re-architecture to a cloud-native model will provide the best long-term value, improving scalability, maintainability, and security, aligning it with modern IT strategy. |
