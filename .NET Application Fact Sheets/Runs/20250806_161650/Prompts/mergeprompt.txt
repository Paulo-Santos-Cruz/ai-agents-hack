## Markdown Formatting Rules (mandatory)
When writing Markdown documents, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure consistency and readability:
- Use **headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content hierarchically.
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for lists.
- Use **tables** where appropriate (e.g., for metrics, dependencies).
- Wrap any code examples in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Use **consistent indentation** and clear formatting throughout.
- Follow clean, simple structure as used in professional technical documentation.
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms or concepts.
- Use **italics** for emphasis on specific terms or concepts.
- Use **links** for references to external documentation or resources.
- Use **inline code** formatting for specific terms or commands (e.g., `Get-Process`).
- Use symbols for pros and cons, e.g., ‚úÖ for pros and ‚ùå for cons.
- Use symbols for impact, e.g., üî¥ for high impact, üü† for medium impact, üü¢ for low impact, writing also the impact as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for risk, e.g., üî¥ for high risk, üü† for medium risk, üü¢ for low risk, writing also the risk as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for long-term fit, e.g., üî¥ for low long-term fit, üü† for medium long-term fit, üü¢ for high long-term fit, writing also the long-term fit as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for priority, e.g., üî¥ for high priority, üü† for medium priority, üü¢ for low priority, writing also the priority as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for severity, e.g., üî¥ for high severity, üü† for medium severity, üü¢ for low severity, writing also the severity as text after the symbol
- **CRITICAL: Severity icon consistency (mandatory)** - NEVER mix these symbols: High/Critical=üî¥ ONLY, Medium=üü† ONLY, Low=üü¢ ONLY. Each severity level must use its exact designated icon throughout the entire document without exception.
- Use symbols for complexity, e.g., üî¥ for high complexity, üü† for medium complexity, üü¢ for low complexity, writing also the complexity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for cost, e.g., üî¥ for high cost, üü† for medium cost, üü¢ for low cost, writing also the cost as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for support, e.g., ‚úÖ for supported, ‚ùå for not supported, writing also the support status as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for used in the application, e.g., ‚úÖ for used in the application, ‚ùå for not used in the application,‚ùî for likely, writing also the used in the application status as text after the symbol¬†¬†

## Generic Mermaid Diagram Rules (mandatory)
When including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown document, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
- **üö® CRITICAL FLOWCHART EDGE SYNTAX WARNING: NEVER use `A --> B: "label"` syntax in flowcharts - this is INVALID and will cause parsing errors. Always use `A -->|"label"| B` instead.**
- **Only the following Mermaid diagram types are allowed**: 'flowchart TD', 'sequenceDiagram','classDiagram','stateDiagram','erDiagram','gantt','journey','gitGraph','pie','mindmap','zenuml','quadrantChart','xychart-beta','block-beta','packet-beta','treemap-beta'.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x (Starts with "Figure X - " (for example, "Figure 1 - ")).
- The Mermaid diagram **must be placed exactly where it is referenced** in the document. Do not place it at the end or elsewhere
- If any node label contains **HTML tags** such as `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc., the **entire label must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`)**.
   - Correct example:
     `step1["Start <b>Process</b>"]`
   - Incorrect example:
     `step1[Start <b>Process</b>]`
     (This will break rendering and must be avoided.)
- Always **validate the Mermaid syntax** before including the diagram. The syntax must be correct to ensure the diagram renders properly in the final Markdown output. If validation is not possible, use only syntax known to be 100% correct.
- **Final checklist before including a Mermaid diagram:**
 - Validate Mermaid syntax to ensure no errors.
 - Enclose any HTML-containing node labels in double quotes.
 - Place the diagram exactly where referenced.
 - Immediately follow the diagram with a properly formatted caption starting with "Figure X -"
 - Make sure the caption is visually secondary and centered.
 - Use the following rules for all Mermaid diagram types (`flowchart`, `classDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, etc.) to ensure valid, portable, and compatible diagrams.

### General Unsupported Syntax (Do Not Use)

- Do not use special characters in identifiers or class names:
  - Avoid: \*, #, /, <>, {}, &, @, \$, \[]
  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores

- Do not use smart quotes:
  - Avoid: ‚Äú ‚Äù, ‚Äò ‚Äô
  - Use plain double or single quotes: "text", 'text'

- Do not use emojis or non-ASCII characters in any labels or class names

- Do not use HTML or Markdown formatting inside labels:
  - Avoid: <b>bold</b>, **bold**, fa\:icon, etc.

- Do not use empty curly braces:
  - Invalid: `class Foo {}` (if no members are defined)
  - Valid: `class Foo` for empty classes

- Do not leave special characters or spaces in labels without wrapping them in quotes:
  - Invalid: A\[User/Admin]
  - Valid: A\["User/Admin"]

- Do not reference undefined nodes or classes in relationships:
  - All identifiers used in edges (A --> B) must be declared

- Do not use multiple edge definitions on a single line:
  - Invalid: A --> B --> C
  - Valid: one edge per line

- Do not use nested or double curly braces like `{{`:
  - Only use `B{"Decision"}` where decision nodes are allowed

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: PascalCase or snake\_case

- Quote all labels containing:

  * Spaces: "Back Office"
  * Special characters: "Read/Write"
  * Dashes or dots: "Version 1.0"

- Format diagrams using fenced code blocks:

  ````
  ```mermaid
  diagramType
  ...
  ````

  ```
  ```

- Use `note` syntax correctly when supported:

  ```
  note for ClassName "Description here"
  ```

- Validate diagrams in your rendering context (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor)

### Diagram-Specific Rules

#### flowchart

- Use square brackets for nodes: A\["Label"]
- Use curly braces only for decisions: B{"Yes or No?"}
- Edges must use -->, <--, --- (no mixing)
- Do not use the class keyword

#### classDiagram

- Use `class ClassName {}` only when listing attributes or methods
- Do not use symbols like "\*" for class names
- For "everything" or "all" access, define a placeholder class such as AllEntities
- Use these for relationships:
  - Inheritance: Child <|-- Parent
  - Association: A ..> B : "Label"

#### sequenceDiagram

- Define all participants before referencing them
- Use only supported message arrows: ->>, -->> etc.
- Loops and conditions must follow valid syntax

### Summary

- Only use plain ASCII characters
- Avoid all special formatting, smart symbols, and undeclared references
- Always test your diagram using a Mermaid-compatible renderer

## Mermaid flowchart TD Diagram Rules (mandatory)
Generate Mermaid flowchart TD diagram with the following constraints:
- No line breaks inside node labels ‚Äî keep all labels on a single line.
- Wrap all node labels in double quotes, especially if they contain special characters (e.g., parentheses, slashes, or commas).
- Avoid using {} to define nodes unless you are explicitly defining a decision node. If used, it must be in the form B{"Decision"} (not {{).
- Use only valid Mermaid syntax:
 - Nodes: "Label" in square brackets: A["Text"]
 - Decision nodes: curly braces with quoted text: B{"Yes or No?"}
 - Terminators or databases: use round or cylinder notation with "Text" inside
 - No indentation is required ‚Äî use one line per statement, no tabs
 - Use plain ASCII characters ‚Äî avoid smart quotes (‚Äú‚Äù) or non-breaking spaces
 - Use only plain text in node labels ‚Äî do not include any icons, HTML, Font Awesome (fa:), or special syntax
 - If grouping nodes with subgraph, ensure the subgraph name is a single word or quoted string
 - Do not use emoji, Markdown, or HTML inside labels
 - **CRITICAL EDGE SYNTAX RULES:**
   - **NEVER use this invalid syntax: `A --> B: "label text"`** - This will cause parsing errors
   - **ALWAYS use one of these valid edge syntaxes:**
     - Simple edge: `A --> B` (no label)
     - Edge with label: `A -->|"label text"| B` (label enclosed in |"text"|)
     - Alternative edge with label: `A -.->|"label text"| B` (dotted line with label)
   - **Examples:**
     - ‚ùå INVALID: `A --> B: "Provides input for"`
     - ‚úÖ VALID: `A -->|"Provides input for"| B`
     - ‚úÖ VALID: `A --> B` (if no label needed)
   - Format all edges with --> or <-->, one per line
   - Never use colon (:) syntax for edge labels in flowcharts

 ## Mermaid classDiagram Diagram Rules (mandatory)
Generate Mermaid classDiagram diagram with the following constraints:
 - Use **valid Mermaid `classDiagram` syntax** only ‚Äî do **not** mix with flowchart or sequence diagram syntax.
 - **Class names must be valid identifiers**:
  - * Use only letters, numbers, and underscores.
  - * Avoid special characters such as `"*"`, `/`, `&`, `<>`, `#`, etc.
-  To indicate "all entities" or similar concepts, use a **valid placeholder class name** like `AllEntities` instead of `"*"`.
- If a class has no attributes or methods, define it as:

  ```
  class ClassName
  ```

  Not:

  ```
  class ClassName {}
  ```
* If a class has attributes or methods, define it like this:

  ```
  class ClassName {
      +attribute: Type
      +methodName()
  }
  ```
- **Do not use curly braces (`{}`)** for class definitions unless they contain properly formatted members.
- **Avoid empty or malformed bodies** like `class Foo { <> }` ‚Äî these will cause syntax errors.
- Use only **plain ASCII characters** ‚Äî avoid smart quotes (‚Äú ‚Äù), emojis, or non-breaking spaces.
- **Do not include HTML, Markdown, icons, or special formatting** in labels or class names.
- Each **relationship line** must use valid Mermaid syntax and reference previously defined classes:
  - Inheritance: `Child <|-- Parent`
  - Association: `A ..> B : "Label"`
- Use `note for ClassName "Text"` for annotations. The class must exist.
. Do not duplicate class declarations.
- One statement per line ‚Äî indentation is optional.
- Always **close string labels with plain double quotes** (`"`), not smart quotes.

## Table format rules (mandatory)
When creating tables in Markdown, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
**When is explicit asked to use table format you MUST use table format**.

For every single user task flow, you must generate a new subsection by following this template precisely. Use sequential numbering (2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.8.3, etc.).

**Template for each user task flow:**

#### 2.9.[Number]. User Task Flow: [User Task Flow Name]
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the [User Task Flow Name], including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made, using a table format.

- **Step** (e.g., Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc.)
- **Description** (e.g., Brief description of the step, e.g., "The user logs into the application to access their dashboard.")
- **User Role** (e.g., User Role involved in the step, e.g., "Data Engineer", "System Administrator", "End User")
- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities involved in the step, e.g., "[PrimaryBusinessObject], [Transaction], [Report].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made for the Step)

Include a Mermaid applicable diagram to visualize this specific user task flow and its relationships or steps.

**Crucially, if 3 user task flows are detected in the summary, you MUST generate sections 2.8.1, 2.8.2, AND 2.8.3. Do not stop after the first one.**

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes any system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction, such as nightly jobs, scheduled reports, or data synchronization tasks, using table format.

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Process Name** (e.g., Nightly Data Aggregation, Inbound File Watcher, etc.)
- **Trigger / Schedule** (e.g., Cron expression, Event-based trigger, etc.)
- **Purpose** (e.g., Brief description of the process's purpose, e.g., "Pre-calculates daily summary data to speed up reporting.")
- **Key Actions** (e.g., List of key actions performed by the process, e.g., "Read all of day's [Transaction] records, Calculate SUM, AVG, COUNT, Write results to [DailySummary] table.")
- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities involved in the process, e.g., "[Transaction], [DailySummary].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made about the process, e.g., "Assumes that the process runs on a nightly schedule to aggregate data. Inferred from method names like `RunScheduledJob`, `ExecuteNightlyProcess`, or `TriggerDataSync` in service classes or controllers.")

##Critical instructions for these sections (Functional overview section an subsections):
- Rule 1: Source Code is the Only Truth. Your analysis **MUST** be based exclusively and entirely on a deep-dive analysis of provided source code. Do **NOT** invent features or use external knowledge about common business practices unless it is a direct and logical inference from a code artifact. Every piece of functionality you document must be traceable to a class, method, UI element, database query, or data model found in the code.
- Rule 2: Explicitly State All Assumptions. When the code's intent is ambiguous (e.g., a poorly named variable or function), you **MUST** make a logical inference and clearly label it as an "Assumption."
 - Example:** In the 'Assumptions' column, write: *"Assuming the boolean flag `is_mgr` in the `User` class denotes a 'Manager' role with supervisory capabilities."
-Rule 3: Functional "What," Not Technical "How."* You must relentlessly translate technical implementation details into business-centric functional descriptions. Your audience is business stakeholders and new developers who need to understand purpose, not implementation.
- **BAD (Technical):** "The `btnSubmit_Click` event handler calls the `SaveOrderToDB` method, which executes an `INSERT` SQL statement."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The 'Submit New Order' feature allows a user to persist the order details into the system's database."
 - **BAD (Technical):** "The system uses a `List<Customer>` object to hold the data."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The system manages a collection of 'Customer' data entities."
- Rule 4: Strict Adherence to the Template. You **MUST** follow the provided Markdown template precisely, section by section. Populate all tables as requested. Generate the specified Mermaid diagrams for each section where they apply, ensuring the syntax is correct and enclosed in proper Markdown code fences (e.g., ` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
- Rule 5: Be Universal and Reusable. Your final output should use generic placeholders (e.g., `[PrimaryBusinessObject]`, `[User Role]`, `[Process Name]`) as instructed in the template. This ensures the document you generate serves as a perfect, reusable template for analyzing any application in the future.
- Do not begin generating the response until you have fully understood these five critical rules.

- **Comments density (%)** (e.g., Percentage of comments in the project, calculated in the code analysis with the value of the metric e.g. 100%)
- **Dead code (%)** (e.g., Percentage of dead code in the project, calculated in the code analysis with the value of the metric e.g. 100%)
- **Estimated compilation time (ms)** (e.g., Estimated compilation time of the project, calculated in the code analysis with the value of the metric in milliseconds e.g. 100ms)

##Instructions:
- *All* projects must be included in the table, not just the main ones or a subset.
- *All* metrics must be included in the table, not just a subset.
- Include always the value of the metric, e.g.,0, 100, 100%, 100ms, etc. N/A is not an acceptable value. 0 when we don't have the metric available is not an acceptable value. In these cases you have to reanalyze the code to get the metric value or remove the metric from the table.

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

Include table with a brief description of each one of the metrics used in the code analysis, e.g., Lines of Code (LOC), Ciclomatic complexity, Inheritance depth, Classes coupling, Maintainability index, etc., with the following columns:
- **Metric** (e.g., Lines of Code, Ciclomatic complexity, Inheritance depth, Classes coupling, Maintainability index, etc.)
- **Description** (e.g., Brief description of the metric, e.g., Lines of Code (LOC) is the total number of lines of code in the project, excluding comments and blank lines, Ciclomatic complexity is a measure of the complexity of the code, Inheritance depth is the average depth of inheritance in the project, Classes coupling is the average coupling between classes in the project, Maintainability index is a measure of the maintainability of the code, etc.)
- **Typical values** (e.g., Typical values for the metric, e.g., Lines of Code (LOC) should be less than 1000, Ciclomatic complexity should be less than 10, Inheritance depth should be less than 3, Classes coupling should be less than 5, Maintainability index should be greater than 70, etc.)

You have to be very rigorous when calculating these metrics, they cannot be approximations, they have to be properly calculated.

##Instructions for this section:
 - Given the detailed analysis of this .NET application, provide three complete modernization strategies in a table format, and the step-by-step plan, also in a table format, to implement them.
 - Strategy 1: **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)**, maintaining the application current deployment model (e.g. on-premises) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 2: **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**, rehosting the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 3: **Refactor** (also known as "Repackage"), refactoring the application to use modern design patterns, architectures and technologies, e.g., microservices, serverless, cloud-native, etc, evolving the application to the latest .NET version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc.
 - Provide a table with comparison between the three strategies, including the pros and cons of each one with the following columns:
  - **Factor** (e.g., Complexity, Cost (Development), Cost (Functional testing), Cost (Infrastructure), Time to implement (Development), Time to test (Functional testing), Time to implement (Infrastructure), Risk, Long-term fit, time-to-market, etc.)
  - **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)
  - **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting)
  - **Complete Refactor** (Refactor)

- The complexity and the time estimate to implement each strategy depends on the following factors which are only related with the development effort and not with the infrastructure or deployment effort:
 - Complexity low - the application is small, with few dependencies and a simple architecture = 1-2 weeks
 - Complexity medium - the application is medium-sized, with some dependencies and a moderate architecture = 3-5 weeks
 - Complexity high - the application is large, with many dependencies and a complex architecture = 6-8 weeks
 - Complexity very high - the application is very large, with many dependencies and a very complex architecture = 9-12 weeks

 ##Instruction: You must separate the development effort from the infrastructure or deployment effort, so the complexity and time estimate must be only related with the development effort.

## 2. Functional overview
This section provides a high-level functional decomposition of the application, identifying the major, distinct functional blocks or modules as inferred from the code's high-level structure.

### 2.1. Executive summary
This section provides a high-level summary of the application's primary purpose and its core function from a business or operational perspective.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Application's Primary Purpose** | The application, "Servi√ßo de Dep√≥sito e Captura de Imagens" (SDCIM), is a comprehensive back-office system designed to automate the processing of bank remittances from various sources, including bank branches (`Balc√£o`) and potentially other channels. |
| **Core Function** | Its core function is to manage the lifecycle of a `Remessa` (remittance), which involves receiving data, processing it in `Tranches`, handling individual `Documentos` (likely cheques), managing their state, and generating alerts for operational monitoring. The system includes a Windows Forms UI (`CIControlo`) for manual monitoring, intervention, and configuration, and a Windows Service (`CIServico`) for automated background processing. |
| **Key Inferred Processes** | - **Remittance Processing**: Automated workflow to process incoming remittances, validate data, and update statuses.<br>- **Alert Management**: A rule-based system to trigger notifications (Email, DB logs) for specific system events or errors.<br>- **Manual Operations & Monitoring**: A user-facing desktop application allowing operators to view activities, manage entities, and resolve issues.<br>- **Configuration**: Management of system parameters, user roles, and branch (`Balcao`) configurations. |

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure.

| Functional Area / Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Interaction & Presentation** | Manages the graphical user interface for operators. This includes forms for monitoring activities, managing configurations, viewing reports, and manually intervening in processes. It is the primary interface between users and the system's core logic. Inferred from `CIActividades`, `CIConfiguration`, `CIFicheirosControlo`, and `MDIsControlo` projects. |
| **Core Process Execution Engine** | The heart of the application, running as a background Windows Service. It orchestrates the automated processing of remittances, alerts, and file imports. It operates based on timers and database queues. Inferred from the `CIServico` and `CIServTester` projects. |
| **Remittance & Document Logic** | Contains the specific business rules for handling remittances. This includes logic for breaking remittances into tranches, processing individual documents, validating data, and managing state transitions. Inferred from the `CIServRemessas` project and classes like `DetalheRemessa`. |
| **Alerting & Notification** | A dedicated subsystem for generating and dispatching alerts. It defines different alert types (e.g., email, log) and the conditions under which they are triggered. Inferred from the `Alerta` and `CIServAlertas` projects. |
| **Data Persistence & Management** | Handles all interactions with the underlying SQL Server database. This includes direct SQL queries for fetching data, updating records, and executing stored procedures. It provides a data access layer for other modules. Inferred from the use of `System.Data.SqlClient` and direct SQL in various classes. |
| **Configuration Management** | Manages global and user-specific application settings, including database connections, user profiles, and operational parameters. Inferred from the `CIConfigGlobalParameters` and `CIConfiguration` projects. |

#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Remittance Processing Workflow
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Remittance Processing Workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Fetch Pending Remittance** | The service queries the database for a remittance with a 'Pending' status. | System | `Remessa` | Inferred from `ServRemessa.REMIN_IDParaProcessar()` method. |
| **2. Begin Processing** | The remittance status is updated to 'Processing' (e.g., state 30) to prevent other threads from picking it up. | System | `Remessa` | A standard practice in queued processing to lock an item. |
| **3. Create Tranches** | The system iterates through the documents of the remittance, creating new `Tranche` records in batches based on a configured size (`m_iMaxDocsTranche`). | System | `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the loop in `ServRemessa.ProcessaRemessa` and the `CriarTranche` method. |
| **4. Process Documents** | For each document, a unique reference key (`ChaveH`) is generated, and its status is updated to 'Processed'. If an error occurs, it's logged. | System | `Documento` | Inferred from `ProcessaDocumento` method which calls `fnCHAVEH` and updates document state. |
| **5. Finalize Remittance** | After all documents are processed, the final status of the remittance is set to 'Processed' (40) or 'Error' (-40) if any issues occurred. | System | `Remessa` | Inferred from the final state update logic in `ServRemessa.ProcessaRemessa`. |

### 2.9. User Task Flows
This section describes the typical path a user takes through the application to achieve a high-level objective.

| Task Flow | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resolve a Failed Remittance** | A complete sequence of steps an administrator follows to diagnose and fix a remittance that has failed during automated processing. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This flow combines monitoring, investigation, and manual intervention features. |
| **Monitor Daily Processing** | A standard daily task for an operator to check the status of all remittances processed within a specific timeframe. | Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | This is a read-only workflow focused on operational awareness. |

#### 2.9.1. User Task Flow: Resolve a Failed Remittance
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Resolve a Failed Remittance" user task flow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identify Failure** | The Administrator opens the `ActividadesForm` and filters by "Erro" (Error) status for the current day. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user knows how to use the UI filters to find problematic items. |
| **2. Investigate Details** | The Administrator double-clicks the failed remittance to view its associated tranches and documents, looking for specific error messages. | Administrator | `Tranche`, `Documento` | The UI provides drill-down capabilities from summary to detail. |
| **3. View Document Image** | If a specific document is the cause, the Administrator views its image using the `ImagemBalcaoForm` to check for quality or data issues. | Administrator | `Documento`, `Imagem` | Assumes document images are available and linked to the document records. |
| **4. Correct State** | After diagnosing the issue, the Administrator uses the "Mudar Estado" context menu action to reset the remittance's status to 'Pending' for reprocessing. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user has the necessary privileges to perform state changes. |
| **5. Verify Reprocessing** | The Administrator monitors the system to ensure the remittance is picked up again by the automated service and processed successfully. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user will re-query the system after a short interval to confirm the state has changed from 'Pending' to 'Processed'. |

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes any system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction.

| Process Name | Trigger / Schedule | Purpose | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Job** | Timer-based, configured by `TempoEntreIteracoes` in settings. | To automatically process new and pending bank remittances as they arrive in the system. | 1. Query for remittances with 'Pending' status.<br>2. Lock and process the remittance.<br>3. Update statuses of remittance, tranches, and documents. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `CIServico` project, which is a Windows Service designed for continuous background execution. The `CIServiceComumThread` suggests a polling mechanism. |
| **Alert Processing Job** | Timer-based, likely sharing the same timer as the remittance job. | To automatically process and dispatch system-generated alerts. | 1. Query for alerts with 'Pending' status.<br>2. Execute the configured action (Email, Log, etc.).<br>3. Update the alert's status. | `Alerta`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `ServAlerta` class, which is designed to be called by the `CIServico` background service. |
| **File Import Job** | Timer-based, configured by `TempoEntreIteracoesFicheiros`. | To automatically import data from `ENVM` and `ACOM` files found in monitored directories. | 1. Scan configured directories for new files.<br>2. Parse the file line-by-line.<br>3. Insert data into staging or final database tables. | `Ficheiro`, `Lote`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `CIFicheiro` project and the `CheckForFileENVM2Import` and `CheckForFileACOM2Import` methods in `CIServicoThread`. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section provides an overview of the application's architecture and design patterns.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a traditional N-Tier monolithic architecture.

| Pattern Type | Identified Patterns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture pattern** | - **N-Tier Monolithic**: The application is structured into distinct layers (presentation, business, data) but is deployed as a single, cohesive unit. |
| **Architectural patterns** | - **Windows Forms (MVP/MVC variant)**: The UI projects (`CIActividades`, etc.) use a code-behind model typical of Windows Forms, separating UI from event-handling logic.<br>- **Windows Service**: The `CIServico` project implements the Windows Service pattern for background processing. |
| **Creational patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: Logic appears to use direct instantiation (`new Class()`) rather than creational patterns like Factory or DI. |
| **Structural patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: The code structure does not show evidence of common structural patterns like Adapter or Decorator. |
| **Behavioral patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: While there are workflows, they are implemented procedurally rather than with formal patterns like Command or Strategy. |
| **Domain-driven design (DDD) patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: The design appears to be data-centric rather than domain-centric. Data structures (`DetalheRemessa`) are tightly coupled to database views, and there is no clear separation of aggregates or a ubiquitous language. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application is built using a layered architectural style.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | The application is structured into logical layers:<br>- **Presentation Layer**: Windows Forms projects (`CIActividades`, `CIConfiguration`).<br>- **Service Layer**: Windows Service and business logic projects (`CIServico`, `CIServRemessas`).<br>- **Data Access Layer**: Although not in a separate project, data access logic using `System.Data.SqlClient` is embedded within service and business classes. |
| **Dependency flow** | Dependencies flow from the UI/Host layers down to the business logic and shared libraries. For example, `CIControlo` depends on `CIActividades`, which in turn depends on `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. There is no strict enforcement preventing lower layers from depending on higher ones, but the general flow is top-down. |
| **Bounded contexts** | The concept of Bounded Contexts is not applied. The application is a single, large monolith with shared data models and dependencies across all functional areas. |
| **Communication between contexts/services** | Communication is primarily through direct method calls within the same process. The only external communication identified is a SOAP web service call in the `MDIWebTransmCI` project. |
| **Use of dependency injection / IOC container** | ‚ùå Not used. Dependencies are managed through direct instantiation (e.g., `new ServRemessa(this, m_oParameters)`). |

### 3.3. Key design patterns and principles applied
The codebase shows adherence to some classic design principles but lacks modern pattern adoption.

| Principle / Pattern | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID principles** | üü† **Partial Adherence**:<br>- **Single Responsibility**: Partially followed, as functionality is broken into different projects (e.g., `CIServAlertas` for alerts, `CIServRemessas` for remittances). However, classes like `ActividadeBalcaoForm` contain significant business and UI logic.<br>- **Open/Closed, Liskov, ISP, DIP**: Not explicitly observed. The lack of interfaces and dependency injection points to low adherence. |
| **DRY (Don't repeat yourself)** | üü† **Medium Risk**: Without the full codebase, it's hard to assess. However, the procedural nature and lack of shared service abstractions suggest a risk of duplicated code, especially for data access and business rules. |
| **KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)** | ‚úÖ **Adhered to**: The code is straightforward and procedural, making individual methods relatively easy to understand in isolation. It avoids overly complex abstractions. |
| **YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it)** | ‚úÖ **Likely Adhered to**: The code appears purpose-built for its specific function without extraneous features. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | üü† **Partial Adherence**: There is a clear separation at the project level (UI, Service, etc.). However, within projects, concerns are mixed. For example, UI forms contain data-fetching logic, and business classes contain direct SQL queries. |
| **Layered architecture** | ‚úÖ **Adhered to**: The solution is clearly organized into Presentation, Service, and Data-centric layers, even if the data access is not formally abstracted. |
| **Testability** | üî¥ **Low**: The tight coupling, lack of dependency injection, and direct database calls make the code difficult to unit test. The `CITestes` project likely performs integration tests rather than isolated unit tests. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
DDD concepts are not a primary driver of the application's design.

| DDD Concept | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: The design is data-centric. Classes like `DetalheDocumento` and `AlertaSituacaoAccao` are direct representations of database views or tables (`SqlDataReader dr` in constructors). There is no evidence of rich domain models, aggregates, value objects, or domain services. |
| **Ubiquitous language** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: While there are business terms like `Remessa` and `Balcao`, they are used as data containers rather than as part of a formal, shared language between developers and domain experts. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: The architecture is a classic N-Tier structure, not a DDD layered architecture with distinct Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. Business logic is mixed with data access and service orchestration. |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application uses a few traditional data access tactics but lacks formal design pattern implementation.

| Pattern / Tactic | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CQRS** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: There is no separation between command (write) and query (read) models or paths. |
| **Event Sourcing** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: State is managed directly in the database, not as a sequence of events. |
| **Repository pattern** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: Data access is performed via direct `SqlDataReader` calls within service or UI-related classes, not abstracted behind a repository interface. |
| **Unit of Work pattern** | üü† **Partially Implemented**: The use of `System.Transactions` and manual transaction management (`BeginTrans`, `Commit`, `RollBack` in `CIGlobalParameters`) provides a form of unit of work for database operations, but it is not formally abstracted as a pattern. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
The application handles cross-cutting concerns through shared utility classes and direct implementation.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | Implemented via a `GenericLog` class, which appears to be a custom or shared library. It provides methods like `GenLogRegistarErro` and `GenLogRegistarAlerta`. |
| **Exception Handling** | Standard `try-catch` blocks are used throughout the code. Exceptions are typically logged using `GenericLog` and sometimes re-thrown or displayed to the user in a `MessageBox`. |
| **Configuration Management** | Handled by the `CIConfigGlobalParameters` project, which reads settings from `.config` files and a central database. It manages connection strings, application timers, and other operational parameters. |
| **Security** | - **Authentication**: A custom user model (`User` class) is used, with login names retrieved from the system.<br>- **Authorization**: A simple role-based model checks the user's group ID (`m_iUserGroup`) to enable or disable functionality. |

### 3.7. Deployment
The deployment architecture is inferred from configuration files and installation scripts.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs microservices**| ‚úÖ **Monolithic**: The application is designed as a single, tightly coupled system, although it is composed of multiple projects. |
| **Containerization** | ‚ùå **Not Supported**: The application is a traditional .NET Framework executable and service, not designed for containerization. |
| **Deployment model** | ‚úÖ **On-premises**: Configuration files and install scripts (`Install.bat`) point to a classic on-premises deployment model. |
| **Deployment target platform** | ‚úÖ **Windows**: The use of Windows Forms, Windows Services, and `.bat` scripts confirms the deployment target is Windows. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application relies on traditional on-premises infrastructure.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | - **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server. The connection strings in `.config` files point to named instances (e.g., `SDC6001SQL28\S2K081`).<br>- **File System**: Used for file-based data ingestion (ACOM/ENVM files) and for logging. |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: There is no evidence of message brokers or event buses. Communication is handled via direct method calls and database polling. |
| **External integrations** | - **SOAP Web Service**: The `MDIWebTransmCI` project integrates with a SOAP web service at `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService` for inserting MDI documents. |

### 3.9. Documentation artifacts

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
This section provides a brief description of each code metric used in the analysis.

| Metric | Description | Typical values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lines of Code (LOC)** | Total number of lines of code, excluding comments and blank lines. A measure of project size. | Lower is generally better for individual components. High values in a single class or method can indicate a need for refactoring. |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. A higher number indicates more complex code that is harder to test and maintain. | < 10: Low risk<br>11-20: Moderate risk<br>21-50: High risk<br>> 50: Very high risk |
| **Inheritance Depth** | The maximum length of a path from a class to the root of the inheritance hierarchy. Deep hierarchies can be complex and hard to maintain. | A depth of 3-5 is generally considered acceptable. Deeper hierarchies can indicate design issues. |
| **Class Coupling** | Measures the number of other classes a single class is dependent on. High coupling makes the system more rigid and harder to change. | < 5: Low coupling<br>5-10: Medium coupling<br>> 10: High coupling |
| **Maintainability Index** | A calculated metric (from 0 to 100) that represents the relative ease of maintaining the code. Higher values are better. | > 20: Maintainable<br>10-19: Moderately maintainable<br>< 10: Difficult to maintain |
| **Code Deduplication** | The percentage of code that is duplicated across the codebase. High duplication increases maintenance effort and risk of bugs. | < 5%: Good<br>5-10%: Acceptable<br>> 10%: High duplication |
| **Comments Density (%)** | The percentage of lines that are comments. Can indicate code complexity or documentation quality. | 15-25% is often cited as a healthy range. Very low values may indicate under-documented code. |
| **Dead Code (%)** | The percentage of code that is unreachable or never executed. | Should be 0%. Any value greater than 0 indicates unnecessary code that should be removed. |

#### 4.5.2. Project metrics

### 5.1.1. Nuget packages
No `packages.config` or direct NuGet package references were found. Dependencies are managed via direct assembly references from a shared network location.

## 6. Security and compliance
This section provides an analysis of the security and compliance aspects of the application.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application employs basic, custom-built security mechanisms.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | A custom identity system is used, managed via the `User` class in `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. It appears to rely on the Windows user login (`System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`). |
| **Authorization** | A simple role-based access control (RBAC) model is implemented by checking the `m_iUserGroup` property of the logged-in user. A value of `1` or less typically grants administrative privileges. |
| **ASP.NET Membership Provider in use** | ‚ùå Not used. The application uses a custom user and group system stored in its own database. |
| **Data protection** | The `AccaoParam.cs` class explicitly masks a field named "passwd" in the UI, suggesting some awareness of password handling, but no encryption mechanisms are visible in the provided code. |
| **Audit logging** | A custom logging mechanism (`GenericLog`) is used to record alerts and errors, which serves as a basic form of audit logging for system events. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
Based on the OWASP Top 10 (2021), the following potential vulnerabilities were identified.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEC-001** | **A01: Broken Access Control** | Insufficient privilege checks. | The `ConfirmaPrivilegios` method checks `m_iUserGroup > 1`, which is a simple integer comparison. This is brittle and could be bypassed if user group data is compromised. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Implement claims-based or more robust role-based authorization. | [OWASP A01](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |
| **SEC-002** | **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Hard-coded password masking. | The check `m_sTIPACCP_NAME.Equals("passwd")` in `AccaoParam.cs` implies password parameters are handled. Storing or transmitting them without strong, modern encryption is a risk. | `AccaoParam.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use a secure vault for secrets and ensure strong, salted hashing for any stored credentials. | [OWASP A02](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/) |
| **SEC-003** | **A03: Injection** | **SQL Injection**. | The use of string concatenation to build SQL queries, as seen in `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, creates a significant SQL injection vulnerability. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use parameterized queries or a modern ORM for all database access. | [OWASP A03](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) |
| **SEC-004** | **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Hard-coded database server names in `.config` files. | Configuration files like `CIControlo.DVP.exe.config` contain server hostnames, exposing infrastructure details. | `.config` files | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Externalize connection strings and other secrets to a secure configuration store like Azure Key Vault. | [OWASP A05](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) |
| **SEC-005** | **A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components** | Use of .NET Framework 4.0. | The application targets .NET Framework 4.0, which is out of support and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. | All `.csproj` files | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Migrate the application to a supported .NET version (e.g., .NET 6+ or .NET Framework 4.8.1). | [Microsoft Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework) |

### 6.3. Advanced and .NET-specific security vulnerabilities
No advanced or framework-specific vulnerabilities beyond the use of an outdated framework were identified in the provided snippets.

### 6.4. Security hardening opportunities

| Setting / File | Issue detected | Description | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CIControlo.*.exe.config** | Environment-specific DB hostnames | `H` (Host) and `D` (Database) settings are hardcoded for DVP, QLD, and PRD environments. This leaks infrastructure topology. | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Use a single configuration file with environment transformations or a centralized configuration service. | [App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/) |
| **SharedLibraryPath.txt** | Hardcoded UNC Path | The path `\\sqc6001fas02\DriveW\GCAA\Gestao\SharedLibrary` points to a network share, creating a dependency on a specific server and exposing its name. | üü† Medium | üü¢ Low | üü† Medium | Use NuGet for package management instead of referencing DLLs from a network share. | [NuGet Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) |

### 6.7. Data exposure and PII handling
The code shows a potential for mishandling of sensitive data.

| Data type | Location (Field / File) | Exposure risk | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Password** | `AccaoParam.cs` | Potential for insecure handling. | The code checks for a parameter named "passwd" and masks it in the UI, but it's unclear how it is stored or transmitted. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Ensure passwords are never stored in plaintext and are handled securely throughout their lifecycle. | [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) |
| **Database Credentials** | `CIGlobalParameters.cs` | Inferred handling of credentials. | The `CIGlobalParameters` class builds connection strings. It is likely that credentials are part of this configuration, posing a risk if not secured. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use integrated security (Windows Authentication) or a managed identity where possible. Avoid storing credentials in config files. | [Connection String Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-strings) |

### 6.8. API-specific vulnerabilities
The application consumes a SOAP service, which could be a point of vulnerability.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API-001** | **(External) A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Insecure transport (HTTP). | The web service endpoint `http://waiaccesstu:80/...` uses HTTP, not HTTPS. All data transmitted is in plaintext. | `MDIWebTransmCI` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | The web service must be configured to use HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate. | [OWASP API A02](https://owasp.org/API-Security/a2-broken-authentication/) |

### 6.9. Cloud-specific configuration issues
The application is on-premises, so this section is not applicable.

### 6.10. Additional risk patterns detected
The following additional risk patterns were identified.

| Test case Id | Category | Risk pattern | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended mitigation | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEC-016** | **Data Access** | Unparameterized SQL Queries | String concatenation is used to build SQL queries, creating a high risk of SQL Injection. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Refactor all data access code to use parameterized queries exclusively. | [SQL Injection Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) |
| **SEC-017** | **Dependencies** | Use of Network Share for DLLs | Dependencies are loaded from a UNC path, which is a fragile and insecure practice. It creates a single point of failure and a security risk if the share is compromised. | All `.csproj` files | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Migrate all shared libraries to a private NuGet feed for secure and versioned dependency management. | [NuGet Feeds](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/overview) |

## 13. Modernization strategy
This section outlines three potential modernization strategies for the SDCIM application.

### 13.1. Modernization strategy comparison
The following table compares the three proposed modernization strategies across several key factors.

| Strategy | Description | Complexity | Development time estimate | Functional testing time estimate | Infrastructure time estimate | Deployment time estimate | Total time estimate | Cost estimate | Risk | Long-term fit | Time-to-market | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)** | Upgrade the application to the latest supported .NET Framework (4.8.1) and update all third-party libraries. The application remains on-premises. | üü† Medium | 3-5 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 1 week | 1 week | 7-10 weeks | üü¢ Low | üü¢ Low | üî¥ Low | üü¢ Fast | ‚úÖ Lowest cost and risk.<br>‚úÖ No architectural changes needed.<br>‚úÖ Resolves immediate security risks from unsupported frameworks. | ‚ùå Does not address architectural flaws.<br>‚ùå Limited scalability and maintainability gains.<br>‚ùå Remains a monolith on legacy infrastructure. |
| **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)** | Re-platform the application to run on a modern cloud infrastructure (e.g., Azure). The Windows Service is containerized and run on Azure Container Apps. The Windows Forms UI is delivered via Azure Virtual Desktop. The database is migrated to Azure SQL. The codebase is upgraded to .NET 8. | üî¥ High | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 15-21 weeks | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | ‚úÖ Moves to a modern, scalable cloud platform.<br>‚úÖ Adopts a modern .NET runtime.<br>‚úÖ Improves security and manageability via cloud services. | ‚ùå Higher cost and complexity than a simple upgrade.<br>‚ùå Does not fully break down the monolith.<br>‚ùå Requires new skills in cloud infrastructure and containerization. |
| **Complete Refactor (Re-architect)** | Re-architect the application to a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture. The remittance processing logic becomes a set of Azure Functions or microservices. The UI is rewritten as a modern web application (e.g., Blazor). | üî¥ Very High | 12+ weeks | 8-10 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 27+ weeks | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üü¢ High | üî¥ Slow | ‚úÖ Achieves maximum scalability, maintainability, and agility.<br>‚úÖ Fully addresses all architectural and technical debt.<br>‚úÖ Aligns with modern development best practices. | ‚ùå Highest cost, risk, and time commitment.<br>‚ùå Requires a complete rewrite of the application.<br>‚ùå Significant testing effort is required. |

### 13.2. Recommendation
The recommended strategy is **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**. This approach provides the best balance of modernization benefits versus cost and risk. It addresses the most critical issue‚Äîthe unsupported .NET Framework‚Äîwhile moving the application to a modern, scalable, and secure cloud platform. It avoids the high cost and risk of a full rewrite, delivering significant value in a moderate timeframe.

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section evaluates the application's position in the IT portfolio.

| Classification | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification** | üü† **Tolerate/Invest**<br><br>The application performs a critical business function (remittance processing) and appears to be stable. However, its underlying technology is obsolete and carries significant security and maintenance risks. It should be tolerated in its current state only for a short period while an investment is made to modernize it. The business value is high, but the technical quality is low. |
| **6R Classification** | üü† **Replatform / Re-architect**<br><br>- **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**: Not recommended as a final state, as it does not address the underlying technical debt.<br>- **Replatform**: The recommended strategy. This involves moving the application to a modern platform (e.g., .NET 8 on Azure) with minimal architectural changes, providing a good balance of cost and benefit.<br>- **Re-architect**: The ideal long-term goal. Breaking the monolith into microservices would provide the most agility and scalability but comes with the highest cost and risk. This should be considered as a phase 2 after a successful replatforming. |
