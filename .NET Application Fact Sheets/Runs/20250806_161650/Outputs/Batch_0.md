#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Remittance Processing Workflow
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Remittance Processing Workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Fetch Pending Remittance** | The service queries the database for a remittance with a 'Pending' status. | System | `Remessa` | Inferred from `ServRemessa.REMIN_IDParaProcessar()` method. |
| **2. Begin Processing** | The remittance status is updated to 'Processing' (e.g., state 30) to prevent other threads from picking it up. | System | `Remessa` | A standard practice in queued processing to lock an item. |
| **3. Create Tranches** | The system iterates through the documents of the remittance, creating new `Tranche` records in batches based on a configured size (`m_iMaxDocsTranche`). | System | `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the loop in `ServRemessa.ProcessaRemessa` and the `CriarTranche` method. |
| **4. Process Documents** | For each document, a unique reference key (`ChaveH`) is generated, and its status is updated to 'Processed'. If an error occurs, it's logged. | System | `Documento` | Inferred from `ProcessaDocumento` method which calls `fnCHAVEH` and updates document state. |
| **5. Finalize Remittance** | After all documents are processed, the final status of the remittance is set to 'Processed' (40) or 'Error' (-40) if any issues occurred. | System | `Remessa` | Inferred from the final state update logic in `ServRemessa.ProcessaRemessa`. |

### 2.9. User Task Flows
This section describes the typical path a user takes through the application to achieve a high-level objective.

| Task Flow | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resolve a Failed Remittance** | A complete sequence of steps an administrator follows to diagnose and fix a remittance that has failed during automated processing. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This flow combines monitoring, investigation, and manual intervention features. |
| **Monitor Daily Processing** | A standard daily task for an operator to check the status of all remittances processed within a specific timeframe. | Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | This is a read-only workflow focused on operational awareness. |

#### 2.9.1. User Task Flow: Resolve a Failed Remittance
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Resolve a Failed Remittance" user task flow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identify Failure** | The Administrator opens the `ActividadesForm` and filters by "Erro" (Error) status for the current day. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user knows how to use the UI filters to find problematic items. |
| **2. Investigate Details** | The Administrator double-clicks the failed remittance to view its associated tranches and documents, looking for specific error messages. | Administrator | `Tranche`, `Documento` | The UI provides drill-down capabilities from summary to detail. |
| **3. View Document Image** | If a specific document is the cause, the Administrator views its image using the `ImagemBalcaoForm` to check for quality or data issues. | Administrator | `Documento`, `Imagem` | Assumes document images are available and linked to the document records. |
| **4. Correct State** | After diagnosing the issue, the Administrator uses the "Mudar Estado" context menu action to reset the remittance's status to 'Pending' for reprocessing. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user has the necessary privileges to perform state changes. |
| **5. Verify Reprocessing** | The Administrator monitors the system to ensure the remittance is picked up again by the automated service and processed successfully. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user will re-query the system after a short interval to confirm the state has changed from 'Pending' to 'Processed'. |

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes any system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction.

| Process Name | Trigger / Schedule | Purpose | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Job** | Timer-based, configured by `TempoEntreIteracoes` in settings. | To automatically process new and pending bank remittances as they arrive in the system. | 1. Query for remittances with 'Pending' status.<br>2. Lock and process the remittance.<br>3. Update statuses of remittance, tranches, and documents. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `CIServico` project, which is a Windows Service designed for continuous background execution. The `CIServiceComumThread` suggests a polling mechanism. |
| **Alert Processing Job** | Timer-based, likely sharing the same timer as the remittance job. | To automatically process and dispatch system-generated alerts. | 1. Query for alerts with 'Pending' status.<br>2. Execute the configured action (Email, Log, etc.).<br>3. Update the alert's status. | `Alerta`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `ServAlerta` class, which is designed to be called by the `CIServico` background service. |
| **File Import Job** | Timer-based, configured by `TempoEntreIteracoesFicheiros`. | To automatically import data from `ENVM` and `ACOM` files found in monitored directories. | 1. Scan configured directories for new files.<br>2. Parse the file line-by-line.<br>3. Insert data into staging or final database tables. | `Ficheiro`, `Lote`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `CIFicheiro` project and the `CheckForFileENVM2Import` and `CheckForFileACOM2Import` methods in `CIServicoThread`. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section provides an overview of the application's architecture and design patterns.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a traditional N-Tier monolithic architecture.

| Pattern Type | Identified Patterns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture pattern** | - **N-Tier Monolithic**: The application is structured into distinct layers (presentation, business, data) but is deployed as a single, cohesive unit. |
| **Architectural patterns** | - **Windows Forms (MVP/MVC variant)**: The UI projects (`CIActividades`, etc.) use a code-behind model typical of Windows Forms, separating UI from event-handling logic.<br>- **Windows Service**: The `CIServico` project implements the Windows Service pattern for background processing. |
| **Creational patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: Logic appears to use direct instantiation (`new Class()`) rather than creational patterns like Factory or DI. |
| **Structural patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: The code structure does not show evidence of common structural patterns like Adapter or Decorator. |
| **Behavioral patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: While there are workflows, they are implemented procedurally rather than with formal patterns like Command or Strategy. |
| **Domain-driven design (DDD) patterns** | - **(Not explicitly identified)**: The design appears to be data-centric rather than domain-centric. Data structures (`DetalheRemessa`) are tightly coupled to database views, and there is no clear separation of aggregates or a ubiquitous language. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application is built using a layered architectural style.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | The application is structured into logical layers:<br>- **Presentation Layer**: Windows Forms projects (`CIActividades`, `CIConfiguration`).<br>- **Service Layer**: Windows Service and business logic projects (`CIServico`, `CIServRemessas`).<br>- **Data Access Layer**: Although not in a separate project, data access logic using `System.Data.SqlClient` is embedded within service and business classes. |
| **Dependency flow** | Dependencies flow from the UI/Host layers down to the business logic and shared libraries. For example, `CIControlo` depends on `CIActividades`, which in turn depends on `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. There is no strict enforcement preventing lower layers from depending on higher ones, but the general flow is top-down. |
| **Bounded contexts** | The concept of Bounded Contexts is not applied. The application is a single, large monolith with shared data models and dependencies across all functional areas. |
| **Communication between contexts/services** | Communication is primarily through direct method calls within the same process. The only external communication identified is a SOAP web service call in the `MDIWebTransmCI` project. |
| **Use of dependency injection / IOC container** | ‚ùå Not used. Dependencies are managed through direct instantiation (e.g., `new ServRemessa(this, m_oParameters)`). |

### 3.3. Key design patterns and principles applied
The codebase shows adherence to some classic design principles but lacks modern pattern adoption.

| Principle / Pattern | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID principles** | üü† **Partial Adherence**:<br>- **Single Responsibility**: Partially followed, as functionality is broken into different projects (e.g., `CIServAlertas` for alerts, `CIServRemessas` for remittances). However, classes like `ActividadeBalcaoForm` contain significant business and UI logic.<br>- **Open/Closed, Liskov, ISP, DIP**: Not explicitly observed. The lack of interfaces and dependency injection points to low adherence. |
| **DRY (Don't repeat yourself)** | üü† **Medium Risk**: Without the full codebase, it's hard to assess. However, the procedural nature and lack of shared service abstractions suggest a risk of duplicated code, especially for data access and business rules. |
| **KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)** | ‚úÖ **Adhered to**: The code is straightforward and procedural, making individual methods relatively easy to understand in isolation. It avoids overly complex abstractions. |
| **YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it)** | ‚úÖ **Likely Adhered to**: The code appears purpose-built for its specific function without extraneous features. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | üü† **Partial Adherence**: There is a clear separation at the project level (UI, Service, etc.). However, within projects, concerns are mixed. For example, UI forms contain data-fetching logic, and business classes contain direct SQL queries. |
| **Layered architecture** | ‚úÖ **Adhered to**: The solution is clearly organized into Presentation, Service, and Data-centric layers, even if the data access is not formally abstracted. |
| **Testability** | üî¥ **Low**: The tight coupling, lack of dependency injection, and direct database calls make the code difficult to unit test. The `CITestes` project likely performs integration tests rather than isolated unit tests. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
DDD concepts are not a primary driver of the application's design.

| DDD Concept | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: The design is data-centric. Classes like `DetalheDocumento` and `AlertaSituacaoAccao` are direct representations of database views or tables (`SqlDataReader dr` in constructors). There is no evidence of rich domain models, aggregates, value objects, or domain services. |
| **Ubiquitous language** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: While there are business terms like `Remessa` and `Balcao`, they are used as data containers rather than as part of a formal, shared language between developers and domain experts. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: The architecture is a classic N-Tier structure, not a DDD layered architecture with distinct Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. Business logic is mixed with data access and service orchestration. |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application uses a few traditional data access tactics but lacks formal design pattern implementation.

| Pattern / Tactic | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CQRS** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: There is no separation between command (write) and query (read) models or paths. |
| **Event Sourcing** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: State is managed directly in the database, not as a sequence of events. |
| **Repository pattern** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: Data access is performed via direct `SqlDataReader` calls within service or UI-related classes, not abstracted behind a repository interface. |
| **Unit of Work pattern** | üü† **Partially Implemented**: The use of `System.Transactions` and manual transaction management (`BeginTrans`, `Commit`, `RollBack` in `CIGlobalParameters`) provides a form of unit of work for database operations, but it is not formally abstracted as a pattern. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
The application handles cross-cutting concerns through shared utility classes and direct implementation.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | Implemented via a `GenericLog` class, which appears to be a custom or shared library. It provides methods like `GenLogRegistarErro` and `GenLogRegistarAlerta`. |
| **Exception Handling** | Standard `try-catch` blocks are used throughout the code. Exceptions are typically logged using `GenericLog` and sometimes re-thrown or displayed to the user in a `MessageBox`. |
| **Configuration Management** | Handled by the `CIConfigGlobalParameters` project, which reads settings from `.config` files and a central database. It manages connection strings, application timers, and other operational parameters. |
| **Security** | - **Authentication**: A custom user model (`User` class) is used, with login names retrieved from the system.<br>- **Authorization**: A simple role-based model checks the user's group ID (`m_iUserGroup`) to enable or disable functionality. |

### 3.7. Deployment
The deployment architecture is inferred from configuration files and installation scripts.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs microservices**| ‚úÖ **Monolithic**: The application is designed as a single, tightly coupled system, although it is composed of multiple projects. |
| **Containerization** | ‚ùå **Not Supported**: The application is a traditional .NET Framework executable and service, not designed for containerization. |
| **Deployment model** | ‚úÖ **On-premises**: Configuration files and install scripts (`Install.bat`) point to a classic on-premises deployment model. |
| **Deployment target platform** | ‚úÖ **Windows**: The use of Windows Forms, Windows Services, and `.bat` scripts confirms the deployment target is Windows. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application relies on traditional on-premises infrastructure.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | - **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server. The connection strings in `.config` files point to named instances (e.g., `SDC6001SQL28\S2K081`).<br>- **File System**: Used for file-based data ingestion (ACOM/ENVM files) and for logging. |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | ‚ùå **Not Used**: There is no evidence of message brokers or event buses. Communication is handled via direct method calls and database polling. |
| **External integrations** | - **SOAP Web Service**: The `MDIWebTransmCI` project integrates with a SOAP web service at `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService` for inserting MDI documents. |

### 3.9. Documentation artifacts

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
This section provides a brief description of each code metric used in the analysis.

| Metric | Description | Typical values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lines of Code (LOC)** | Total number of lines of code, excluding comments and blank lines. A measure of project size. | Lower is generally better for individual components. High values in a single class or method can indicate a need for refactoring. |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. A higher number indicates more complex code that is harder to test and maintain. | < 10: Low risk<br>11-20: Moderate risk<br>21-50: High risk<br>> 50: Very high risk |
| **Inheritance Depth** | The maximum length of a path from a class to the root of the inheritance hierarchy. Deep hierarchies can be complex and hard to maintain. | A depth of 3-5 is generally considered acceptable. Deeper hierarchies can indicate design issues. |
| **Class Coupling** | Measures the number of other classes a single class is dependent on. High coupling makes the system more rigid and harder to change. | < 5: Low coupling<br>5-10: Medium coupling<br>> 10: High coupling |
| **Maintainability Index** | A calculated metric (from 0 to 100) that represents the relative ease of maintaining the code. Higher values are better. | > 20: Maintainable<br>10-19: Moderately maintainable<br>< 10: Difficult to maintain |
| **Code Deduplication** | The percentage of code that is duplicated across the codebase. High duplication increases maintenance effort and risk of bugs. | < 5%: Good<br>5-10%: Acceptable<br>> 10%: High duplication |
| **Comments Density (%)** | The percentage of lines that are comments. Can indicate code complexity or documentation quality. | 15-25% is often cited as a healthy range. Very low values may indicate under-documented code. |
| **Dead Code (%)** | The percentage of code that is unreachable or never executed. | Should be 0%. Any value greater than 0 indicates unnecessary code that should be removed. |

### 5.1.1. Nuget packages
No `packages.config` or direct NuGet package references were found. Dependencies are managed via direct assembly references from a shared network location.

## 6. Security and compliance
This section provides an analysis of the security and compliance aspects of the application.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application employs basic, custom-built security mechanisms.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | A custom identity system is used, managed via the `User` class in `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. It appears to rely on the Windows user login (`System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`). |
| **Authorization** | A simple role-based access control (RBAC) model is implemented by checking the `m_iUserGroup` property of the logged-in user. A value of `1` or less typically grants administrative privileges. |
| **ASP.NET Membership Provider in use** | ‚ùå Not used. The application uses a custom user and group system stored in its own database. |
| **Data protection** | The `AccaoParam.cs` class explicitly masks a field named "passwd" in the UI, suggesting some awareness of password handling, but no encryption mechanisms are visible in the provided code. |
| **Audit logging** | A custom logging mechanism (`GenericLog`) is used to record alerts and errors, which serves as a basic form of audit logging for system events. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
Based on the OWASP Top 10 (2021), the following potential vulnerabilities were identified.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEC-001** | **A01: Broken Access Control** | Insufficient privilege checks. | The `ConfirmaPrivilegios` method checks `m_iUserGroup > 1`, which is a simple integer comparison. This is brittle and could be bypassed if user group data is compromised. | `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Implement claims-based or more robust role-based authorization. | [OWASP A01](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |
| **SEC-002** | **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Hard-coded password masking. | The check `m_sTIPACCP_NAME.Equals("passwd")` in `AccaoParam.cs` implies password parameters are handled. Storing or transmitting them without strong, modern encryption is a risk. | `AccaoParam.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use a secure vault for secrets and ensure strong, salted hashing for any stored credentials. | [OWASP A02](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/) |
| **SEC-003** | **A03: Injection** | **SQL Injection**. | The use of string concatenation to build SQL queries, as seen in `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, creates a significant SQL injection vulnerability. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs` | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use parameterized queries or a modern ORM for all database access. | [OWASP A03](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) |
| **SEC-004** | **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Hard-coded database server names in `.config` files. | Configuration files like `CIControlo.DVP.exe.config` contain server hostnames, exposing infrastructure details. | `.config` files | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Externalize connection strings and other secrets to a secure configuration store like Azure Key Vault. | [OWASP A05](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) |
| **SEC-005** | **A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components** | Use of .NET Framework 4.0. | The application targets .NET Framework 4.0, which is out of support and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. | All `.csproj` files | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Migrate the application to a supported .NET version (e.g., .NET 6+ or .NET Framework 4.8.1). | [Microsoft Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework) |

### 6.3. Advanced and .NET-specific security vulnerabilities

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CIControlo.*.exe.config** | Environment-specific DB hostnames | `H` (Host) and `D` (Database) settings are hardcoded for DVP, QLD, and PRD environments. This leaks infrastructure topology. | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | üü† Medium | Use a single configuration file with environment transformations or a centralized configuration service. | [App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/) |
| **SharedLibraryPath.txt** | Hardcoded UNC Path | The path `\\sqc6001fas02\DriveW\GCAA\Gestao\SharedLibrary` points to a network share, creating a dependency on a specific server and exposing its name. | üü† Medium | üü¢ Low | üü† Medium | Use NuGet for package management instead of referencing DLLs from a network share. | [NuGet Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) |

### 6.7. Data exposure and PII handling
The code shows a potential for mishandling of sensitive data.

| Data type | Location (Field / File) | Exposure risk | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Password** | `AccaoParam.cs` | Potential for insecure handling. | The code checks for a parameter named "passwd" and masks it in the UI, but it's unclear how it is stored or transmitted. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Ensure passwords are never stored in plaintext and are handled securely throughout their lifecycle. | [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) |
| **Database Credentials** | `CIGlobalParameters.cs` | Inferred handling of credentials. | The `CIGlobalParameters` class builds connection strings. It is likely that credentials are part of this configuration, posing a risk if not secured. | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | üî¥ High | Use integrated security (Windows Authentication) or a managed identity where possible. Avoid storing credentials in config files. | [Connection String Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-strings) |

### 6.8. API-specific vulnerabilities

### 13.2. Recommendation
The recommended strategy is **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**. This approach provides the best balance of modernization benefits versus cost and risk. It addresses the most critical issue‚Äîthe unsupported .NET Framework‚Äîwhile moving the application to a modern, scalable, and secure cloud platform. It avoids the high cost and risk of a full rewrite, delivering significant value in a moderate timeframe.

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section evaluates the application's position in the IT portfolio.

| Classification | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification** | üü† **Tolerate/Invest**<br><br>The application performs a critical business function (remittance processing) and appears to be stable. However, its underlying technology is obsolete and carries significant security and maintenance risks. It should be tolerated in its current state only for a short period while an investment is made to modernize it. The business value is high, but the technical quality is low. |
| **6R Classification** | üü† **Replatform / Re-architect**<br><br>- **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**: Not recommended as a final state, as it does not address the underlying technical debt.<br>- **Replatform**: The recommended strategy. This involves moving the application to a modern platform (e.g., .NET 8 on Azure) with minimal architectural changes, providing a good balance of cost and benefit.<br>- **Re-architect**: The ideal long-term goal. Breaking the monolith into microservices would provide the most agility and scalability but comes with the highest cost and risk. This should be considered as a phase 2 after a successful replatforming. |
