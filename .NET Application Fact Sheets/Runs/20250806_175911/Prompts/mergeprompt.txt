## Markdown Formatting Rules (mandatory)
When writing Markdown documents, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure consistency and readability:
- Use **headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content hierarchically.
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for lists.
- Use **tables** where appropriate (e.g., for metrics, dependencies).
- Wrap any code examples in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Use **consistent indentation** and clear formatting throughout.
- Follow clean, simple structure as used in professional technical documentation.
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms or concepts.
- Use **italics** for emphasis on specific terms or concepts.
- Use **links** for references to external documentation or resources.
- Use **inline code** formatting for specific terms or commands (e.g., `Get-Process`).
- Use symbols for pros and cons, e.g., ✅ for pros and ❌ for cons.
- Use symbols for impact, e.g., 🔴 for high impact, 🟠 for medium impact, 🟢 for low impact, writing also the impact as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for risk, e.g., 🔴 for high risk, 🟠 for medium risk, 🟢 for low risk, writing also the risk as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for long-term fit, e.g., 🔴 for low long-term fit, 🟠 for medium long-term fit, 🟢 for high long-term fit, writing also the long-term fit as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for priority, e.g., 🔴 for high priority, 🟠 for medium priority, 🟢 for low priority, writing also the priority as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for severity, e.g., 🔴 for high severity, 🟠 for medium severity, 🟢 for low severity, writing also the severity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for complexity, e.g., 🔴 for high complexity, 🟠 for medium complexity, 🟢 for low complexity, writing also the complexity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for cost, e.g., 🔴 for high cost, 🟠 for medium cost, 🟢 for low cost, writing also the cost as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for support, e.g., ✅ for supported, ❌ for not supported, writing also the support status as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for used in the application, e.g., ✅ for used in the application, ❌ for not used in the application,❔ for likely, writing also the used in the application status as text after the symbol  

## Generic Mermaid Diagram Rules (mandatory)
When including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown document, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
- **Only the following Mermaid diagram types are allowed**: 'flowchart TD', 'sequenceDiagram','classDiagram','stateDiagram','erDiagram','gantt','journey','gitGraph','pie','mindmap','zenuml','quadrantChart','xychart-beta','block-beta','packet-beta','treemap-beta'.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x (Starts with "Figure X - " (for example, "Figure 1 - ")).
- The Mermaid diagram **must be placed exactly where it is referenced** in the document. Do not place it at the end or elsewhere
- If any node label contains **HTML tags** such as `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc., the **entire label must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`)**.
   - Correct example:
     `step1["Start <b>Process</b>"]`
   - Incorrect example:
     `step1[Start <b>Process</b>]`
     (This will break rendering and must be avoided.)
- Always **validate the Mermaid syntax** before including the diagram. The syntax must be correct to ensure the diagram renders properly in the final Markdown output. If validation is not possible, use only syntax known to be 100% correct.
- **Final checklist before including a Mermaid diagram:**
 - Validate Mermaid syntax to ensure no errors.
 - Enclose any HTML-containing node labels in double quotes.
 - Place the diagram exactly where referenced.
 - Immediately follow the diagram with a properly formatted caption starting with "Figure X -"
 - Make sure the caption is visually secondary and centered.
 - Use the following rules for all Mermaid diagram types (`flowchart`, `classDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, etc.) to ensure valid, portable, and compatible diagrams.

### General Unsupported Syntax (Do Not Use)

- Do not use special characters in identifiers or class names:
  - Avoid: \*, #, /, <>, {}, &, @, \$, \[]
  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores

- Do not use smart quotes:
  - Avoid: “ ”, ‘ ’
  - Use plain double or single quotes: "text", 'text'

- Do not use emojis or non-ASCII characters in any labels or class names

- Do not use HTML or Markdown formatting inside labels:
  - Avoid: <b>bold</b>, **bold**, fa\:icon, etc.

- Do not use empty curly braces:
  - Invalid: `class Foo {}` (if no members are defined)
  - Valid: `class Foo` for empty classes

- Do not leave special characters or spaces in labels without wrapping them in quotes:
  - Invalid: A\[User/Admin]
  - Valid: A\["User/Admin"]

- Do not reference undefined nodes or classes in relationships:
  - All identifiers used in edges (A --> B) must be declared

- Do not use multiple edge definitions on a single line:
  - Invalid: A --> B --> C
  - Valid: one edge per line

- Do not use nested or double curly braces like `{{`:
  - Only use `B{"Decision"}` where decision nodes are allowed

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: PascalCase or snake\_case

- Quote all labels containing:

  * Spaces: "Back Office"
  * Special characters: "Read/Write"
  * Dashes or dots: "Version 1.0"

- Format diagrams using fenced code blocks:

  ````
  ```mermaid
  diagramType
  ...
  ````

  ```
  ```

- Use `note` syntax correctly when supported:

  ```
  note for ClassName "Description here"
  ```

- Validate diagrams in your rendering context (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor)

### Diagram-Specific Rules

#### flowchart

- Use square brackets for nodes: A\["Label"]
- Use curly braces only for decisions: B{"Yes or No?"}
- Edges must use -->, <--, --- (no mixing)
- Do not use the class keyword

#### classDiagram

- Use `class ClassName {}` only when listing attributes or methods
- Do not use symbols like "\*" for class names
- For "everything" or "all" access, define a placeholder class such as AllEntities
- Use these for relationships:
  - Inheritance: Child <|-- Parent
  - Association: A ..> B : "Label"

#### sequenceDiagram

- Define all participants before referencing them
- Use only supported message arrows: ->>, -->> etc.
- Loops and conditions must follow valid syntax

### Summary

- Only use plain ASCII characters
- Avoid all special formatting, smart symbols, and undeclared references
- Always test your diagram using a Mermaid-compatible renderer

The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure, using table format. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities the role interacts with, e.g., "User, Role, Permission, SystemConfig
, AuditLog.")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the role, e.g., "Inferred from code blocks checking for a specific role name ('Admin'), a boolean flag ('isAdmin'), or a user ID of 0 or 1.")

Include a Mermaid 'classDiagram' diagram to visualize the relationships between the user roles, their permissions, and the key data entities they interact with.

### 2.4. Core business capabilities
This section lists the main, high-level capabilities of the application, representing its "Epics" or major functional domains, using table format

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities, e.g., "[InputData], [StagingRecord], [ImportLog].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the capability, e.g., "Assumes that any module listening for external input (file watchers, API endpoints) is part of this capability. Inferred from service layers or classes with names like `Processor`, `Engine`, `Calculator`, or `Orchestrator`.") 

Include a Mermaid applicable diagram to visualize the core business capabilities and their relationships.

### 2.5. Detailed feature breakdown
This critical section provides a granular breakdown of individual features within each Core Business Capability, using table format. Each feature is described in terms of its user story, key data entities involved, and any inferred logic or flowcharts that illustrate the internal workings.

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Feature** (e.g., Execute [Process Name], Generate [Report Name], etc.)

##Critical instructions for these sections (Functional overview section an subsections):
- Rule 1: Source Code is the Only Truth. Your analysis **MUST** be based exclusively and entirely on a deep-dive analysis of provided source code. Do **NOT** invent features or use external knowledge about common business practices unless it is a direct and logical inference from a code artifact. Every piece of functionality you document must be traceable to a class, method, UI element, database query, or data model found in the code.
- Rule 2: Explicitly State All Assumptions. When the code's intent is ambiguous (e.g., a poorly named variable or function), you **MUST** make a logical inference and clearly label it as an "Assumption."
 - Example:** In the 'Assumptions' column, write: *"Assuming the boolean flag `is_mgr` in the `User` class denotes a 'Manager' role with supervisory capabilities."
-Rule 3: Functional "What," Not Technical "How."* You must relentlessly translate technical implementation details into business-centric functional descriptions. Your audience is business stakeholders and new developers who need to understand purpose, not implementation.
- **BAD (Technical):** "The `btnSubmit_Click` event handler calls the `SaveOrderToDB` method, which executes an `INSERT` SQL statement."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The 'Submit New Order' feature allows a user to persist the order details into the system's database."
 - **BAD (Technical):** "The system uses a `List<Customer>` object to hold the data."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The system manages a collection of 'Customer' data entities."
- Rule 4: Strict Adherence to the Template. You **MUST** follow the provided Markdown template precisely, section by section. Populate all tables as requested. Generate the specified Mermaid diagrams for each section where they apply, ensuring the syntax is correct and enclosed in proper Markdown code fences (e.g., ` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
- Rule 5: Be Universal and Reusable. Your final output should use generic placeholders (e.g., `[PrimaryBusinessObject]`, `[User Role]`, `[Process Name]`) as instructed in the template. This ensures the document you generate serves as a perfect, reusable template for analyzing any application in the future.
- Do not begin generating the response until you have fully understood these five critical rules.

##Instructions for this section:
 - Given the detailed analysis of this .NET application, provide three complete modernization strategies in a table format, and the step-by-step plan, also in a table format, to implement them.
 - Strategy 1: **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)**, maintaining the application current deployment model (e.g. on-premises) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 2: **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**, rehosting the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 3: **Refactor** (also known as "Repackage"), refactoring the application to use modern design patterns, architectures and technologies, e.g., microservices, serverless, cloud-native, etc, evolving the application to the latest .NET version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc.
 - Provide a table with comparison between the three strategies, including the pros and cons of each one with the following columns:
  - **Factor** (e.g., Complexity, Cost (Development), Cost (Functional testing), Cost (Infrastructure), Time to implement (Development), Time to test (Functional testing), Time to implement (Infrastructure), Risk, Long-term fit, time-to-market, etc.)
  - **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)
  - **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting)
  - **Complete Refactor** (Refactor)

- The complexity and the time estimate to implement each strategy depends on the following factors which are only related with the development effort and not with the infrastructure or deployment effort:
 - Complexity low - the application is small, with few dependencies and a simple architecture = 1-2 weeks
 - Complexity medium - the application is medium-sized, with some dependencies and a moderate architecture = 3-5 weeks
 - Complexity high - the application is large, with many dependencies and a complex architecture = 6-8 weeks
 - Complexity very high - the application is very large, with many dependencies and a very complex architecture = 9-12 weeks

 ##Instruction: You must separate the development effort from the infrastructure or deployment effort, so the complexity and time estimate must be only related with the development effort.

- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x.
- ALWAYS VALIDATE / ENSURE THE DIAGRAM SYNTAX BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT, TO ENSURE IT IS CORRECT AND WILL RENDER PROPERLY IN THE FINAL MARKDOWN OUTPUT.

#Critical instructions for the caption (always apply):
- Immediately following the ` ```mermaid ` code block, you MUST place a text **caption**.

## 2. Functional overview
This section provides a high-level functional decomposition of the application, using table format. It identifies the major, distinct functional blocks or modules as inferred from the code's high-level structure (e.g., top-level namespaces, solution folders, primary class groups). This overview serves as a map to the application's core responsibilities.

### 2.1. Executive summary
This section provides a high-level summary of the application's primary purpose and its core function from a business or operational perspective, using table format. The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | The application functions as a backend processing system for bank remittances (cheques, deposits). It handles the reception of remittance files, processes transactions in batches (tranches), manages alerts for different situations, and provides a Windows-based user interface for monitoring and manual intervention. |
| **Core Function** | To automate the processing of bank deposit remittances, manage their lifecycle from reception to clearing, handle exceptions through an alerting mechanism, and provide operational staff with tools for monitoring and manual control over the process. |
| **Key Inferences** | - The system is designed for a banking environment, specifically "Grupo Caixa Geral de Depósitos", as seen in assembly info.<br>- It processes standard banking files like `ACOM` and `ENVM`.<br>- It has both automated (Windows Service) and manual (WinForms GUI) operational modes.<br>- The architecture separates concerns into distinct projects for UI, services, data entities, and file processing. |

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application. The decomposition is based on the organization of namespaces, classes, and methods, as well as the relationships between them.

| Functional Area / Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Remittance Processing Engine** | This is the core of the application, responsible for the end-to-end processing of remittances. It includes logic for creating tranches, validating data, and updating the status of documents and remittances. This module is primarily driven by the `CIServico` Windows Service and the logic within the `CIServRemessas` project. |
| **User Interaction & Monitoring** | Manages all user-facing interfaces. This includes displaying the status of remittances, documents, and system alerts. It allows operators to perform manual interventions, such as changing the state of a remittance or re-triggering a process. This functionality is encapsulated within the `CIActividades` and `CIControlo` projects. |
| **File Ingestion & Parsing** | This module is responsible for handling data input from external files. It likely contains file watchers and parsers for specific banking formats (`ACOM`, `ENVM`). The `CIFicheiro` project contains the logic for reading and interpreting these files before they are handed off to the processing engine. |
| **Alerting and Notification System**| A cross-cutting concern that provides a framework for generating and dispatching alerts based on system events or errors. It can send notifications via email, write to log files, or record events in the database. The `Alerta` and `CIServAlertas` projects implement this functionality. |
| **Configuration and Administration** | Provides interfaces and logic for managing system parameters, user accounts, and operational settings like bank branch (`Balcao`) configurations. This is handled by the `CIConfiguration` project. |
| **Reporting** | This module is responsible for generating business and operational reports. It uses Crystal Reports to create documents based on data from the application's database, covering areas like monthly invoicing and remittance summaries. |

### 2.3. User roles and permissions
This section identifies the distinct types of users that interact with the application. These roles are inferred from authorization checks found in the code, such as the `ConfirmaPrivilegios` method.

| Role | Description | Permissions | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | A privileged user with full access to system functions, including state changes and configuration. | - Full CRUD on most data entities.<br>- Ability to change the state of remittances and tranches.<br>- Access to system configuration and user management. | `MudarEstado`, `ReenviarRemessas`, `Configuracao` | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `User`, `Balcao` | Inferred from `m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup <= 1` checks, which grant access to sensitive operations like changing object states. |
| **Standard Operator** | A standard user with view-only or limited operational capabilities. | - View remittance and document status.<br>- Generate reports.<br>- Perform basic searches. | `Refresh`, `ViewDetails`, `GenerateReport` | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Alerta` | Inferred as the default role for any user with `m_iUserGroup > 1`. This role is likely restricted from performing state-changing actions. |

```mermaid

        +m_sUserName: string
        +m_iUserGroup: int
    }

### 2.5. Detailed feature breakdown
This section provides a granular breakdown of individual features within each Core Business Capability.

| Feature | User Story / Description | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process Over-the-Counter Remittance** | As a **System**, I can process a batch of over-the-counter remittances so that cheque and deposit data is correctly entered into the system for clearing. This involves creating tranches and processing individual documents. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `ProcessarTrancheBalcao` and `ServRemessa` classes. |
| **Change Remittance State** | As an **Administrator**, I can manually change the state of a remittance (e.g., from 'Error' to 'Pending') to correct processing issues or re-trigger a failed job. | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | Inferred from the `MudarEstadoForm` and the context menus in `ActividadesForm` that allow state changes. |
| **Send Alert Email** | As the **System**, when a specific situation occurs (e.g., a processing error), I can send an email notification to a configured list of recipients so that operators are informed of the event. | `Alerta`, `Accao`, `SituacaoAccao` | Inferred from `ServAlertasSendWebmail.cs` and the `Accao.enuTipoAccao.MAILWEBDAV` enum value. |
| **View Remittance Details** | As an **Operator**, I can drill down from a summary view of remittances to see the detailed list of individual remittances, tranches, and the documents they contain, so that I can investigate specific transactions. | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This is the primary function of the `ActividadesForm` and `ActividadeBalcaoForm`, which use nested ListViews to display hierarchical data. |

### 2.7. Business process workflows
This section describes and visualizes critical end-to-end processes.

| Process | Description | Key Steps | User Roles Involved | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automated Remittance Processing** | A fully automated workflow where the system ingests remittance files, processes them, and sends them for clearing without manual intervention. | 1. Ingest `ENVM`/`ACOM` files.<br>2. Create `Remessa` records.<br>3. Process documents and create `Tranche` records.<br>4. Update status to `Processado` or `Enviada`.<br>5. Trigger alerts on error. | System | `Ficheiro`, `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento`, `Alerta` | Inferred from the `CIServico` Windows Service, which runs background tasks for file processing and remittance handling. |
| **Manual State Correction** | An operator-driven workflow to manually correct the state of a remittance or tranche that has encountered an error. | 1. User opens `ActividadesForm`.<br>2. User searches for a remittance in an error state.<br>3. User selects the item and chooses "Mudar Estado".<br>4. System updates the record's status, potentially re-queuing it for processing. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | Inferred from the context menus and state-changing forms (`MudarEstadoForm`) in the UI projects. |
| **Alert Handling** | The process by which the system detects an issue, creates an alert, and executes the configured notification actions. | 1. An error occurs during processing.<br>2. An `Alerta` record is created with a specific `SITUACAO_ID`.<br>3. The alerting service (`CIServAlertas`) picks up the alert.<br>4. The service performs the associated `Accao` (e.g., sends an email). | System, Administrator (recipient) | `Alerta`, `SituacaoAccao`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `Alerta` project and the `ProcessarAlertas` class. |

#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Automated Remittance Processing
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Automated Remittance Processing workflow, including the steps involved, user roles, key data entities, and any assumptions made.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. File Ingestion** | The `CIServico` Windows Service monitors specific file system directories for new `ENVM` or `ACOM` files. When a new file is detected, it is parsed. | System | `Ficheiro` | Inferred from `CIFicheiro` project and file-related settings. Assumes a file watcher pattern. |
| **2. Remittance Creation** | Based on the parsed file data, new `Remessa` and `Documento` records are created in the database with an initial status (e.g., 'Awaiting Processing'). | System | `Remessa`, `Documento` | Inferred from the data model. Assumes a direct mapping from file records to database entities. |
| **3. Tranche Processing** | The `CIServRemessas` logic groups documents from a remittance into one or more `Tranche` objects for batch processing. This is likely done to manage memory and transaction size. | System | `Tranche`, `Documento` | Inferred from the `ProcessarTrancheBalcao` and `TratarTranchesBalcao` methods. |
| **4. State Update** | As processing completes successfully, the status of each `Documento`, `Tranche`, and `Remessa` is updated to reflect its progress (e.g., 'Processado', 'Enviada'). | System | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This is a standard pattern in batch processing systems to track job status. |
| **5. Error Handling** | If any step fails, the status is updated to an error state (e.g., -40), and an `Alerta` is triggered to notify operators. | System | `Remessa`, `Alerta` | Inferred from `try-catch` blocks that call `updateRemssaErro` and `EnviarAlertaSituacao`. |

#### 2.7.2. Workflow: Manual State Correction
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Manual State Correction workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. View Activities** | The user launches the `CIActividades` or `ActividadeBalcaoForm` and uses the filters to find a specific remittance or tranche that is in an error state. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | The UI is designed for monitoring and filtering processing activities. |
| **2. Select Item** | The user selects one or more items from the list view that require a state change. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | The UI supports single and potentially multiple selections for bulk actions. |
| **3. Invoke State Change** | The user right-clicks to open a context menu and selects the "Mudar Estado" (Change State) option. | Administrator | - | The context menu is the primary mechanism for triggering actions on a selected item. |
| **4. Choose New State** | The `MudarEstadoForm` appears, showing the current state and a dropdown list of permissible next states. The user selects the target state and confirms. | Administrator | - | The application has a predefined state machine, and the form only allows valid transitions. |
| **5. System Update** | The application executes a stored procedure or direct SQL query to update the status of the selected record(s) in the database. | System | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | The action triggers a database update. The method `ChangeEstado` in `DetalheRemessa.cs` confirms this. |

### 2.8. System inputs & outputs (interfaces)
This section catalogs all identified points where data enters or leaves the application boundary.

| Type | Name / Description | Data Formats | Data Source / Sink | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | **File Ingestion (ACOM/ENVM)** | Fixed-width text files | Monitored file system directory | The `CIFicheiro` project is designed for batch file processing. The names `ACOM` and `ENVM` suggest standard banking formats. |
| **Input** | **User Actions (WinForms UI)** | User-entered data (e.g., filter criteria, state changes) | `CIControlo` and `CIActividades` WinForms applications | The application has a rich client interface for manual operations and monitoring. |
| **Output** | **Database Records** | SQL Data | Microsoft SQL Server | The application's primary function is to process data and persist the results and state in a relational database. |
| **Output** | **Log Files** | Text | Local file system | `ServAlertasLogFile.cs` explicitly creates and writes to log files as an alerting action. |
| **Output** | **Windows Event Log** | Event Log Entry | Windows Operating System | `ServAlerta.cs` uses `EventLog.WriteEntry` to log alerts to the system's event log. |
| **Output** | **Email Notifications** | SMTP/EWS | External Email Server | `ServAlertasSendWebmail.cs` is a dedicated class for constructing and sending emails. |
| **Output** | **SOAP Web Service Call** | XML (SOAP) | External Web Service (`waiaccesstu`) | The `MDIWebTransmCI` project is a SOAP client for an external service, indicating data is sent out of the system boundary. |
| **Data Flow** | **Internal Database Flow** | SQL Data | Application Memory <-> Database | Data is read from the database into business objects, processed, and then written back. This is the main internal data flow. |

### 2.9. User Task Flows
This section describes the typical path a user takes through the application to achieve a high-level objective.

| Task Flow | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monitor Daily Processing** | A standard operator's daily routine of checking the status of all remittances processed within a specific timeframe to ensure smooth operations. | Standard Operator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento` | This is the primary use case for the `ActividadesForm`, which defaults to showing today's activities. |
| **Troubleshoot a Failed Remittance** | An administrator's task of investigating a remittance that has failed, identifying the cause, and taking corrective action. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento`, `Alerta` | This flow combines monitoring with the manual state correction workflow. |
| **Configure a New Bank Branch** | An administrator's task of setting up a new bank branch (`Balcao`) and its associated document processing machines in the system. | Administrator | `Balcao`, `Maquina` | Inferred from the `CIConfiguration` project and the `BalcaoForm`, which allows for the creation and management of branches and their machines. |

<center>Figure 10 - High-level diagram showing the relationships between different user task flows.</center>

#### 2.9.1. User Task Flow: Troubleshoot a Failed Remittance
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Troubleshoot a Failed Remittance" user task flow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identify Error** | The user opens the `ActividadesForm` and filters the view to show only remittances in an error state (e.g., status -40). | Administrator | `Remessa` | The UI provides filtering capabilities based on status codes. |
| **2. Investigate Details** | The user selects the failed remittance and double-clicks to view its associated tranches and documents, looking for specific error messages in the "Erro" column. | Administrator | `Tranche`, `Documento` | The drill-down functionality is the primary method for investigation. |
| **3. View Document Image** | If a specific document is suspected, the user double-clicks it to open the `ImagemBalcaoForm` to visually inspect the cheque image for issues like poor quality or incorrect data. | Administrator | `Documento` | The system stores and can display images of the processed documents. |
| **4. Correct State** | After identifying the root cause, the user navigates back to the remittance or tranche, right-clicks, and uses the "Mudar Estado" form to reset its status to a processable state (e.g., 'Pendente'). | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche` | The user has the necessary privileges to alter the state of processing objects. |
| **5. Verify Re-processing** | The user monitors the activity screen to ensure the re-queued remittance is picked up by the `CIServico` and processed successfully. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The system's automated service will eventually re-process items that are put back into a pending state. |

### 2.10. Automated & Scheduled Processes
This section describes system-triggered processes that run without direct user interaction.

| Process Name | Trigger / Schedule | Purpose | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Processing Loop** | Continuous loop within the `CIServico` Windows Service, with a configurable delay between iterations. | The central engine of the application, responsible for orchestrating all background tasks. | - Calls `CheckForRemessas2Process`<br>- Calls `CheckForAlertas2Process`<br>- Calls `CheckForFileENVM2Import`<br>- Calls `CheckForFileACOM2Import`<br>- Calls `CheckForTranchesRemessasBalcao2Process` | Inferred from the `while (!m_bStop)` loop in `CIServicoThread.cs`. This is the application's main event loop. |
| **Remittance Processing Job** | Triggered by the Main Processing Loop when `Select_Remessa2Process` returns a remittance ID. | To process newly created or pending remittances from the GCCA source. | - Updates remittance status to 'In Progress'.<br>- Creates tranches.<br>- Processes documents within tranches.<br>- Updates final status to 'Processed' or 'Error'. | Inferred from the `CheckForRemessas2Process` method and the `ServRemessa.ProcessaRemessa` logic. |
| **Alerting Job** | Triggered by the Main Processing Loop when `AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar` finds a pending alert. | To dispatch notifications for system events or errors. | - Reads pending alerts from the database.<br>- Determines the action type (Email, Log, etc.).<br>- Executes the action (e.g., calls `ServAlertasSendWebmail`).<br>- Marks the alert as processed. | Inferred from the `CheckForAlertas2Process` method and the logic in the `CIServAlertas` project. |
| **File Import Job** | Triggered by the Main Processing Loop on a timer (`Time2ImportFile`). | To ingest new `ENVM` and `ACOM` files from the file system. | - Scans configured directories for new files.<br>- Parses the file line by line.<br>- Inserts data into staging or final database tables.<br>- Moves the processed file to a backup location. | Inferred from `CheckForFileENVM2Import` and `CheckForFileACOM2Import` methods. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section provides an overview of the application's architecture and design, inferred from the source code structure, project relationships, and coding patterns.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a traditional N-Tier architecture, which is common for .NET Framework applications of its era.

| Pattern Type | Pattern(s) Used | Observations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Level Architecture** | **N-Tier, Monolithic** | The application is structured into logical layers (Presentation, Business, Data Access) but is deployed as a single, cohesive set of executables and libraries. There is no evidence of microservices or a distributed architecture. |
| **UI/Presentation Patterns** | **Model-View-Controller (MVC) - variant** | The WinForms code exhibits a separation between the Form (View), event handlers (Controller), and data-handling classes (Model-like objects, e.g., `DetalheRemessa`), though it is not a strict, modern MVC implementation. |
| **Creational Patterns** | ✅ **None explicitly identified** | The code primarily uses direct instantiation (`new MyClass()`) rather than formal creational patterns like Factory or Abstract Factory. |
| **Structural Patterns** | ❔ **Likely Adapter** | The `MDIWebTransmCI` project acts as an adapter between the application's internal logic and the external SOAP web service, translating method calls into web service requests. |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | ❔ **Likely Observer (implicit)** | The main service loop in `CIServicoThread` acts like an observer, polling the database for state changes (new remittances, new alerts) and reacting to them. |
| **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Patterns** | ❌ **None identified** | The application appears to be data-centric, with logic tightly coupled to the database schema. There is no evidence of a rich domain model, aggregates, or a ubiquitous language. Data access is direct via SQL rather than through repositories. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application's style is characterized by distinct layers and a clear, albeit coupled, dependency flow.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | **3-Tier Layered Architecture**: <br>1. **Presentation Layer**: `CIControlo`, `CIActividades`, and other WinForms projects.<br>2. **Business Logic Layer**: `CIServico`, `CIServRemessas`, `CIServAlertas`. This layer contains the core processing logic.<br>3. **Data Access Layer**: Although not in a separate project, this layer is implemented within business logic classes via direct use of `System.Data.SqlClient` to execute SQL queries and stored procedures. |
| **Dependency flow** | **Top-down**: The UI layer depends on the business logic layer, and the business logic layer depends on the shared/core layer (`CIConfigGlobalParameters`) and the database. There are no upward dependencies, which is a key characteristic of a layered architecture. |
| **Bounded contexts** | ❌ **Not formally used**. The application is monolithic, and while projects separate concerns (e.g., `Alerta`, `Remessas`), they all share the same database and configuration, indicating a single, large bounded context. |
| **Communication between contexts/services** | N/A (Monolithic internal communication is via direct method calls). External communication is synchronous (SOAP web service). |
| **Use of dependency injection / IOC container** | ❌ **None identified**. Dependencies are manually created and passed through constructors or method parameters (e.g., `new ServRemessa(this, m_oParameters)`). |

### 3.3. Key design principles applied
The codebase reflects design principles common in older .NET applications.

| Principle | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID principles** | 🟠 **Partial Adherence**: <br>- **Single Responsibility**: Partially followed at the project level (e.g., `CIReports` for reporting). However, classes like `ActividadesForm` contain significant UI, event handling, and data access logic, violating SRP. <br>- **Open/Closed**: The design is not easily extensible without modification. Adding a new alert type, for example, would require changing the `switch` statement in `ServAlerta.cs`. |
| **DRY (Don't repeat yourself)** | 🟠 **Inconsistent**: There is some code reuse through shared libraries like `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. However, there are instances of repeated logic, such as the UI setup code in multiple `Form` classes. |
| **KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)** | ✅ **Generally Followed**: The code is straightforward and procedural. It avoids complex abstractions, making individual methods relatively easy to understand, although the overall system has high complexity due to its size. |
| **YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it)** | ✅ **Likely Followed**: The code appears to be focused on specific business requirements without extraneous features. The direct, data-centric approach suggests a pragmatic implementation style. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | 🟠 **Partial**: There is a clear separation at the project level (UI, Service, etc.). However, within classes, concerns are often mixed. For example, UI Forms contain direct database query construction and execution logic. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
The application does not follow a Domain-Driven Design approach.

| DDD Concept | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | ❌ **None**: The code is data-centric. Classes like `DetalheRemessa` are essentially anemic data transfer objects that map closely to database views or tables, rather than rich domain entities with behavior. |
| **Ubiquitous language** | ❌ **Not evident**: While there is consistent naming related to the domain (e.g., `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Balcao`), there is no formal, shared language between developers and domain experts reflected in the code as a rich model. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | ❌ **Not applied**: The architecture is a classic N-Tier, not the layered architecture prescribed by DDD (UI, Application, Domain, Infrastructure). |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application uses several fundamental software patterns, though not always in their formal, modern implementations.

| Pattern/Tactic | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CQRS** | ❌ **Not used**. The same objects and data access methods are used for both reading (queries for display) and writing (updates). |
| **Event Sourcing** | ❌ **Not used**. The system state is stored as the current state in the database, not as a sequence of events. |
| **Repository pattern** | ❌ **Not used**. Data access is performed directly within service or form classes using `System.Data.SqlClient` and raw SQL strings or stored procedure calls. |
| **Unit of Work pattern**| ❌ **Not used**. Transactions are managed manually using `m_oParameters.BeginTrans()` and `Commit()`/`RollBack()`, but there is no formal Unit of Work pattern to group operations. |
| **Factory pattern** | ❌ **Not used**. Objects are instantiated directly with `new`. |
| **Mediator pattern**| ❌ **Not used**. Components communicate directly. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
The application handles cross-cutting concerns through shared utility classes and direct implementation.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | Implemented via a custom `GenericLog` class, which appears to be a wrapper around a logging framework or direct DB/file writes. Calls like `GenericLog.GenLogRegistarErro` are spread throughout the code. |
| **Caching** | ❌ **No evidence of caching**: There are no references to `System.Runtime.Caching` or common caching libraries like Redis or Memcached. Data appears to be fetched from the database on each request. |
| **Security** | - **Authentication**: A custom database-backed user/group system is implemented via the `User` class. <br>- **Authorization**: Performed via imperative checks on the user's group ID (e.g., `if (m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup > 1)`). |
| **Exception Handling** | Handled with `try-catch` blocks. Some blocks are empty (`catch {}`), which is an anti-pattern. Errors are typically logged using `GenericLog` and displayed to the user via `MessageBox.Show`. |
| **Configuration Management** | Managed by the `CIConfigGlobalParameters` project and `.config` files. It uses a custom `ConfigGlobalParameters` base class to read settings. |
| **Dependency Injection** | ❌ **Not used**. Dependencies are passed manually. |
| **Internationalization (i18n)** | ❌ **Not supported**. All UI text and messages are hardcoded in Portuguese. |

### 3.7. Deployment
The deployment architecture is typical for an on-premises, monolithic .NET application.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs microservices** | **Monolithic**: The application is a single, large codebase deployed as a set of tightly coupled executables and libraries. |
| **Scalability design** | **Vertical Scaling**: Scalability is limited to increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of the server hosting the application and the database. There is no design for horizontal scaling (load balancing across multiple instances). |
| **Cloud-native design** | ❌ **Not cloud-native**: The application is designed for a traditional on-premises environment, with dependencies on specific server names and file paths. |
| **Containerization** | ❌ **Not containerized**: No `Dockerfile` or container-related artifacts are present. |
| **Serverless architecture** | ❌ **Not serverless**: The architecture relies on long-running processes (Windows Service) and a stateful database. |
| **Deployment model** | **On-premises**: Inferred from hardcoded UNC paths and internal server names in configuration files. |
| **Deployment target platform** | **AnyCPU**: Configured to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application relies on a traditional client-server infrastructure.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | **Microsoft SQL Server**: All data is stored in a relational database. The use of `System.Data.SqlClient` and server names like `SDC6001SQL28\S2K081` confirm this. Different databases are used for different environments (DVP, QLD, PRD). |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | ❌ **None**: Communication is handled via direct method calls and database polling, not through a message broker like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. |
| **External integrations** | - **File System**: The application monitors directories for `ENVM` and `ACOM` files. <br>- **SOAP Web Service**: The `MDIWebTransmCI` project consumes an external SOAP service at `http://waiaccesstu:80/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService`. <br>- **Email**: Integrates with an email server to send alert notifications. |

## 6. Security and compliance
This section details the security mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities identified in the application.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application employs basic, custom-built security mechanisms.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Custom authentication based on the current Windows user (`System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName`). The `User` class queries the database to fetch user details and group membership. |
| **Authorization** | Role-based authorization implemented via imperative code. Methods check the user's group ID (`m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup`) to permit or deny actions. A group ID of 1 or less is considered privileged. |
| **ASP.NET Membership** | ❌ Not used. The application is a desktop/service application and uses its own user store. |
| **Data protection** | 🟠 **Limited**: A password field in `AccaoParam.cs` is masked before display, but there is no evidence of strong encryption for data at rest or in transit within the provided code. |
| **Audit logging** | ✅ **Yes**: The `GenericLog` library is used to log alerts and errors, which serves as a form of audit trail for significant system events. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
Based on the OWASP Top 10, several critical vulnerabilities have been identified.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 13. Modernization strategy
Given the use of an end-of-life framework and other legacy practices, a modernization strategy is critical for the long-term viability of this application.

### 13.1. Modernization strategy comparison
This section compares three potential modernization strategies.

| Strategy | Description | Complexity | Development time estimate | Functional testing time estimate | Infrastructure time estimate | Deployment time estimate | Total time estimate | Cost estimate | Risk | Long-term fit | Time-to-market | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lift and Shift (On-premises)** | Upgrade projects to .NET Framework 4.8.1 and latest compatible libraries. Keep on-premises deployment. | 🟠 Medium | 3-5 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 1 week | 1 week | 7-10 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟢 Low | 🔴 Low | 🟢 Low | ✅ Fast to implement<br>✅ Low risk of functional regressions<br>✅ No infrastructure changes | ❌ Remains on legacy .NET Framework<br>❌ Does not address architectural debt<br>❌ Limited scalability |
| **Lift and Shift (Rehost to Cloud)** | Upgrade to .NET Framework 4.8.1 and migrate the application and database to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure VM and Azure SQL). | 🟠 Medium | 3-5 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 9-14 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | ✅ Introduces cloud benefits (IaaS)<br>✅ Improves reliability and manageability<br>✅ Step towards further modernization | ❌ Still on legacy .NET Framework<br>❌ Does not fully leverage cloud-native features<br>❌ Higher operational cost than on-prem |
| **Complete Refactor (Cloud-Native)** | Rewrite the application to target modern .NET (e.g., .NET 8). Decompose into a web-based UI (Blazor) and a backend Worker Service or Azure Functions. Use EF Core and secure data access patterns. | 🔴 High | 9-12 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 21-29 weeks | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🟢 High | 🔴 High | ✅ Addresses all technical debt<br>✅ Fully supported and secure stack<br>✅ Cloud-native, scalable, and maintainable<br>✅ Best long-term value | ❌ Highest cost and effort<br>❌ Highest risk of functional regressions<br>❌ Longest time-to-market |

### 13.2. Recommendation
The recommended strategy is a **phased refactor**, starting with a Lift and Shift to the cloud to immediately mitigate some infrastructure risks, followed by a progressive rewrite of components.

**Recommended Strategy: Hybrid (Rehost then Refactor)**

1.  **Phase 1: Rehost to Cloud.** Move the application as-is (or with a minimal upgrade to .NET 4.8.1) to Azure VMs and Azure SQL. This immediately gets the application off aging on-premises hardware and unsupported OS/SQL versions. This is a quick win that improves reliability and security posture.
2.  **Phase 2: Refactor.** Once in the cloud, begin a component-by-component refactoring process:
    *   Rewrite the `CIServico` as a modern .NET Worker Service.
    *   Rewrite the `CIActividades` UI as a Blazor Web App.
    *   Address the SQL injection vulnerabilities by creating a new data access layer with Entity Framework Core.
    *   Decommission the old components as they are replaced.

This approach balances risk, cost, and time-to-market while providing a clear path to a modern, supportable, and scalable application.

#### 13.2.1. Step-by-step plan
This plan outlines the key steps for the recommended **Hybrid (Rehost then Refactor)** strategy.

| Phase | Step | Description | Key Actions | Estimated Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1: Rehost** | **1.1: Analysis & Cloud Setup** | Analyze current infrastructure dependencies. Set up Azure networking, resource groups, Azure SQL, and VMs. | - Document network dependencies.<br>- Create Azure resources (VNet, RG, SQL Server).<br>- Configure security groups. | 1 week |
| | **1.2: Database Migration** | Migrate the on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database. | - Use Azure Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess compatibility.<br>- Use Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) to perform the migration.<br>- Update connection strings in `.config` files. | 2 weeks |
| | **1.3: Application Lift & Shift** | Deploy the `CIControlo.exe` and `CIServico.exe` applications to Azure Virtual Machines. | - Create VM images.<br>- Install .NET Framework 4.8.1.<br>- Deploy application binaries.<br>- Configure file shares for input/output. | 1 week |
| | **1.4: Testing & Go-Live** | Perform full regression and user acceptance testing in the new Azure environment. | - Execute test plans.<br>- Validate integrations (file shares, web service).<br>- Plan and execute the cutover. | 2 weeks |
| **2: Refactor** | **2.1: Modernize Backend Service** | Rewrite the `CIServico` Windows Service as a .NET 8 Worker Service. | - Create new .NET 8 project.<br>- Port business logic from `CIServRemessas`, `CIServAlertas`, `CIFicheiro`.<br>- Replace file system polling with Azure Blob Storage triggers. | 4-6 weeks |
| | **2.2: Refactor Data Access** | Create a new data access layer using Entity Framework Core and the Repository pattern to eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities. | - Define EF Core DbContext and entities.<br>- Replace all direct `SqlClient` calls with repository methods.<br>- Integrate the new data layer into the Worker Service. | 3-4 weeks |
| | **2.3: Modernize UI** | Rewrite the `CIActividades` and `CIControlo` WinForms applications as a single Blazor Web App. | - Design new UI components.<br>- Create a new Blazor project.<br>- Build pages for monitoring, configuration, and reporting.<br>- The new UI will call an API layer (or directly the service logic if co-hosted). | 5-7 weeks |
| | **2.4: Decommission & Finalize** | Once the new components are live and stable, decommission the old VMs and legacy code projects. | - Archive old source code.<br>- Shut down and delete the legacy VMs.<br>- Final documentation update. | 1 week |

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section evaluates the application's strategic fit using the TIME and 6R models.

| Classification Model | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification** | **Tolerate/Migrate**: The application provides high business value as it handles a core banking process (remittance processing). However, its technical quality is very low due to the use of end-of-life frameworks and databases, significant security vulnerabilities (SQLi), and a monolithic, hard-to-maintain architecture. It should be **tolerated** in the short term while an aggressive **migration/refactoring** plan is executed. |
| **6R Classification** | **Refactor/Re-architect**: <br>- **Retain**: Not a viable long-term option due to critical security and supportability risks. <br>- **Retire/Replace**: A full replacement would be costly and high-risk given the core business function. <br>- **Rehost**: A good initial step to de-risk the infrastructure, but it doesn't solve the core application-level problems. <br>- **Replatform**: A minimal upgrade to .NET 4.8.1 is a form of replatforming, but it is insufficient. <br>The most appropriate strategy is to **Refactor** the application progressively, or fully **Re-architect** it using modern, cloud-native principles to align its technical quality with its high business value. |
